### Update Information

**This release includes all changes from [v1.16.0 (YANKED)] as well as the following:**

If you already installed v1.16.0 and successfully ran migrations, please run the
following command **before** updating to this version.

```shell
python manage.py migrate aasrp 0006
```

This will re-set your migrations to the state of v1.15.2, and you can update as you
would normally do from here.

If you haven't installed v1.16.0 yet, you can just update as usual.

### Fixed

- Migration error for MySQL8 (`django.db.utils.OperationalError: (1292, "Incorrect
  datetime value: '0000-00-00 00:00:00' for column 'comment_time' at row 1")`)
  Thanks to Rhaven (on AA support Discord) for reporting and testing this

### Removed

- Python 3.11 from tests. AA is not tested yet with it, and it's not even stable at
  the moment.

### Changed

- Ship is now a proper EveType model instead of just a string


## Important Update Instructions

**IMPORTANT**

If you update from v0.1.0-beta.4 or earlier, make sure to read carefully.

In this version the way the SRP ship is handled has changed. It is no longer just a
simple string in the database, it is now a proper EveType model. So you have to do
some extra steps to migrate your data.

**This needs to be done right after you have updated AA SRP from a version prior
v0.1.0-beta.5.**

### Step 1 - Install EveUniverse

This should be done automatically with the update, but there is still a bit of
manual work to it. First you need to add the EveUniverse module to your
`INSTALLED_APPS` in your `loca.py`.

- Add `"eveuniverse",` to `INSTALLED_APPS`


### Step 2 - Static collection and migration

Now that EveUniverse is installed, you need to run the static collection and
migration. Don't forget to restart your supervisor afterwards.

```shell
python manage.py collectstatic
```

```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

Restart your supervisor services for Auth

### Step 3 - Import ship information from ESI

This is where the magic happens. You are now ready to import the ship information
from ESI.

```shell
python manage.py aasrp_load_eve
```


### Step 4 - Migrate your SRP data

Now that we have all the needed information, your SRP data needs to be updated. This
is just another simple command.

```shell
python manage.py aasrp_update_db_relations
```


## [0.1.0-beta.4] - 2020-12-28

### Fixed

- Permissions on "Edit AAR Link" view some ajax requests


## [0.1.0-beta.3] - 2020-12-28

- First public beta release
