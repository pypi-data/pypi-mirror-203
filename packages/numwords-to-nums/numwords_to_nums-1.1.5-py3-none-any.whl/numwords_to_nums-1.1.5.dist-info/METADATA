## Installation
```
pip3 install numwords_to_nums
```

## Usage
Python 3 only!
```
from numwords_to_nums.numwords_to_nums import NumWordsToNum
num = NumWordsToNum()
num.numerical_words_to_numbers("twenty ten and twenty one")
> 2010 and 21

To use our operator converter 
num = NumWordsToNum()
text = "one point two plus two"
num.numerical_words_to_numbers(text, convert_operator = True)
> 1.2+2

To get the evaluation result of any numerical expression
num = NumWordsToNum()
text = "one point two plus two"
result = num.numerical_words_to_numbers(text, convert_operator = True)
num.evaluate(result)
> 3.2
```

It can handle a variety of phrases. It also maintains ordinals such as first--> 1st and also supports negative numbers.

```
"This is just a random sentence." -> 'This is just a random sentence.'
"I am twenty five years old and my dad is 50 years old. I would like to get my father two cars!" -> 'I am 25 years old and my dad is 50 years old. I would like to get my father 2 cars!'
"I was born in twenty ten" -> 'I was born in 1997'
"The temperature of the room was minus seven so I had to turn on the heater." -> 'The temperature of the room was -7 so I had to turn on the heater.'
"In the year twenty twenty one, the forty sixth President of the United States was inaugurated." -> 'In the year 2021, the 46th President of the United States was inaugurated.'
"Joe Biden became the oldest person to assume the presidency at the age of seventy eight." -> 'Joe Biden became the oldest person to assume the presidency at the age of 78.'
"He was elected in November twenty twenty after defeating the incumbent, Donald Trump." -> 'He was elected in November 2020 after defeating the incumbent, Donald Trump.'
"Bidens inauguration took place on January twentieth, which marked the fifty ninth quadrennial presidential inauguration." -> 'Bidens inauguration took place on January 20th, which marked the 59th quadrennial presidential inauguration.'
"The event was held at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., and was attended by a limited number of people due to the COVID-nineteen pandemic." -> 'The event was held at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., and was attended by a limited number of people due to the COVID-19 pandemic.'
"Despite the challenges, the fifty ninth presidential inauguration was a historic moment for the country." -> 'Despite the challenges, the 59th presidential inauguration was a historic moment for the country.'
"three forty five" -> '345'
"one point two plus two" -> '1.2+2'  (To use this make sure to use flag (convert_operator = True))
"one point two plus two" -> '3.2' (To use this make sure to use evaluate function)
"zero point five plus zero point five" -> '0.5+0.5'
"zero point five plus zero point five" -> '1.0'
```

I find this useful if converting audio to text and have to convert the text to digits, operators, numerical expressions as well as evaluating them.
It also find it helpful when converting ordinals to numbers as it maintains the suffix.
