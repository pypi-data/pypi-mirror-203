Used to have a normal looking object that can be imported directly into other modules and used.

It will in reality, always lookup currently active version of a Dependency and use that each
time it's asked anything.

This makes it 'act' like the current version of some dependency,
code and just use it like a normal object.

See one of these for more details:

    Used to simplify accessing the current dependency class via proxy object,
    so you can use the object like a normal global-object, but every time you access a
    normal (non-private) attribute/method it will grab you the one from the currenly active
    dependency.

    >>> class MyClass(Dependency):
    ...   def my_method(self):
    ...      pass

    Typically, to access attributes of a particular dependency subclass you would have to do this:

    >>> MyClass.grab().my_method()

    With ProxyActive you can do this instead:

    >>> my_class = CurrentDependencyProxy.wrap(MyClass)
    >>> my_class.my_method()

    This will always call the active/current dependency without having to use the boilerplate
    `.dependency()` method on the dependency class/type.

    >>> # You can use the `proxy` convenience
    >>> # method to also accomplish this:
    >>> my_class = MyClass.proxy()

    It's sometimes useful to put at the top-level of a module the proxy-version of the dependency
    so it can be directly imported into other modules, and used directly like a normal object.

    >>> # We are in some other Module;
    >>> # import the 'my_class' we defined above.

        See `CurrentDependencyProxy` for and overview. Init method doc below.

        ## Init Method

        When you create a CurrentDependencyProxy, you pass in the `dependency_type` you want
        it to proxy.

        Will act like the current/active object of Dependency type `dependency_type`.
        you can optionally provide a grabber function, that will be called with the current
        dependency passed to it.  You can then grab something from that dependency and return it.
        If you pass in a grabber function, this ProxyActive will act like a proxy of whatever
        is returned from the grabber method.

        Args:
            dependency_type: Type of dependency to proxy.
            grabber: Optional callable, if you wish to grab a specific attribute off the dependency
                and act like a proxy for that, you can pass in a method here to do so.
                Whatever is returned from the grabber is what is used to as the object to 'proxy'.
            repr_info: Will provide this additional info if self gets `repr()` called on it
                (ie: if used/shown in debugger, etc).
                Example: Currently used to show the attribute-name/info being proxied when you use
                `xinject.dependency.Dependency.proxy_attribute`.
