take_it_easy
================

<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

The game has two modes:

“play”: In the play mode, the entire game will be simulated including
drawing tiles randomly. This is usefull to play with the computer or to
train an Reinforcement Learning algorithm

“input”: In input mode, the user specifies what tile has been drawn,
e.g., when playing a real-life game

## Install

``` sh
pip install take_it_easy
```

## How to use

To play the game with random actions:

``` python
from take_it_easy.tiles import Tiles
from take_it_easy.board import Board
from take_it_easy.play import play_random_game
```

``` python
board = Board()
tiles = Tiles()
play_random_game(board, tiles, return_board = True)
```
