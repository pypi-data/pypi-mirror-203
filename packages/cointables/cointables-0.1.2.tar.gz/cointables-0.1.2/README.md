# cointables

Cointables is a Python package that provides a simple and convenient framework to extract historical Open-High-Low-Close (OHLC) data for various cryptocurrencies from Binance. Cointables supports different sampling methods and GET approaches, allowing users to customize their data extraction process. This is a fork from [bitcharts](https://github.com/andrewrgarcia/bitcharts)


## Installation

Cointables can be installed using pip:

```

It is recommended you run voxelmap using a `virtualenv` virtual environment. To do so, follow the below simple protocol to create the virtual environment, run it, and install the package there:

```

To exit the virtual environment, simply type deactivate. To access it at any other time again, enter with the above source `venv...` command.
