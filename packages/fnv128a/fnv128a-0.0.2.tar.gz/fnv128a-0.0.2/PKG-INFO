# fnv128a

If you're like me and are using Go's implementation of fnv128a in [hash/fnv](https://pkg.go.dev/hash/fnv) and have need to compute identical hashes in Python, then look no further.

## Installation

I've created a super bare-bones pyproject.toml, just enough
to build the package and push to pypi and consquently advise
you just pip install via:

```
pip install fnv128a
```
