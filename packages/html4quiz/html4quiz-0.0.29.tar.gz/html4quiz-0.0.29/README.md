# html4quiz

## What is it?

html4quiz is a package that helps you generate question sheets with as many HTML files as you want and grade answers from text files submitted by students.

## Features
<ul>
<li>Everything is on your local PC, grows with your creativity, and you own them all.</li>
<li>Question sheets in HTML files, each named with a corresponding identification number, are distributed to students over the network.</li>
<li>Students use their mobile devices to read, answer questions, save answers to a text file for submission within the same HTML page, and submit the text file as directed over the network.</li>
<li>Grading answers from text files submitted by students can be done with a few keystrokes.</li>
<li>A question begins with a short answer in a number or word.</li>
<li>Questions with numeric answers can be converted to multiple choice questions simply by flipping the flag.</li>
<li>Questions can start with multiple choice.</li>
<li>Mathematical equations in LaTeX format can be included in both question texts and choices.</li>
<li>Figures can be included in both question text and choices.</li>
<li>Question text, mathematical equations, and figures are all randomly selected for each question sheet in a controlled manner.</li>
<li>Randomness is acquired by executing the answer string, which is a short Python script, that is part of question.</li>
<li>To increase your creativity, user-defined functions can be easily added for the answer string.</li>
</ul>
