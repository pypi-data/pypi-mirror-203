# pyolaf - A Python-based 3D reconstruction framework for light field microscopy

pyolaf is a Python port of the [oLaF](https://gitlab.lrz.de/IP/olaf/) 3D reconstruction framework for light field microscopy (LFM). 

## Overview
  
The light field microscope (LFM) allows for 3D imaging of fluorescent specimens using an array of micro-lenses (MLA) that capture both spatial and directional light field information in a single shot. oLaF is a Matlab framework for 3D reconstruction of LFM data with a deconvolution algorithm that reduces aliasing artifacts.

pyolaf brings these same features to the Python ecosystem, using GPU acceleration and some further code optimizations to **speed up deconvolution by 20x**. 

## Limitations

pyolaf only supports regular grids and single-focus conventional light-field microscopes.
In particular Fourier LFM, hexagonal grids, and multi-focus lenslets are currently not supported.
Pull requests to add these are welcome!
