Optimisation models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally, this library should allow the optimisation of district heating grids
with various configurations settings and different approaches.
The optimisation methods of this library are tools to assist the
planning process of DHS projects and to analyze the economic feasibility of DHS
for a given district, community or city - either by focusing on the DHS itself,
or by also considering the overall energy system of a district, which could not
just be the heating sector, but also the electricity, mobility sector or the
gas infrastructure.

At the moment, there is one approach using *oemof-solph* as linear optimisation library
implemented. This approach is explained in the following sections. It totally makes sense to have
some experiences with *oemof-solph* to understand this toolbox more easily.

Scope
-----

The following questions can be addressed using the `optimize_investment` method
of the *ThermalNetwork*:

* What is the cost-optimal topology and dimensioning of a DHS piping system, 
  given the locations of potential central heat supply plants, the potential
  locations for the DHS piping system (e.g. street network),
  and the position of consumers?
* In addition to the first question, what is the cost-optimal expansion
  of a given DHS system?
* Is it cost-efficient to build a DHS at all, if there a consumer-wise heat
  supply alternatives? (Comparison of central and de-central supply strategies)
* What is the optimal dispatch of the heat producers? (In case there are no
  expansion options, but just existing DHS pipes)
* Planned: Streets-wise aggregation option

To answer these questions, at the moment,
the LP and MILP optimisation library oemof.solph is used.
Other approaches, e.g. heuristic approaches, might follow.

The following sections will give an overview about the general usage/workflow,
(the necessary input data, the different optimisation settings and options,
the results), and second, the underlying mathematical description.

.. _Overview:

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The optimisation of a given *ThermalNetwork* is executed by:

.. code-block:: python

    import dhnx

    tnw = dhnx.network.ThermalNetwork()
    
    tnw = network.from_csv_folder('path/to/thermal_network')

    invest_opt = dhnx.input_output.load_invest_options('path/to/invest_options')

    tnw.optimize_investment(invest_options=invest_opt)

For executing an optimisation, you must provide :ref:`investment options<add_invest_options>`
additional to the previous
data, which defines a *ThermalNetwork*. Both are explained in the following section.

.. _Input Data:

Input Data
~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, it is firstly revised, what input data is exactly necessary
from the *ThemalNetwork* class, and then explained, what data needs to be
provided as :ref:`investment options <add_invest_options>`, and what
:ref:`optimisation settings<Optimization settings>` you can apply.

The following figure provides an overview of the input data:

.. 	figure:: _static/DHNx_Input_data.svg
   :width: 100 %
   :alt: optimization_input_data.svg
   :align: center

   Fig. 1: Optimisation Input Data

The structure of the input data might look a bit confusing at the beginning, but provides a lot of
options for building up complex district heating models.
There are two groups of data: Firstly, data that describes the components
and the connectivity of the network, required by the ThermalNetwork class.
Secondly, data that is necessary for the investment optimization.
For now, all data needs to be provided in csv files. This means that you do not need to provide a
geo-reference for applying an district heating network optimisation model at all.
Probably, in many cases, it is the
export of four geo-referenced layers (e.g. geopandasdataframe, shp-file, or any other), which are
a line layer representing the potential places for the DHS-trenches, and three point layers for the
producers, the consumers, and the potential forks of the DHS system. All geometry information of
the network system is passed by an *id* for each element. Thus, the line layer connects all points
and provides the spatial relation with the attributes *from_node*, *to_node*, and *length*. If you
prepare the data, be careful that every consumer is connected to an pipe, and every piping
network system is connected to at least one producer.

.. _TN_Input :

ThermalNetwork
""""""""""""""

The data for the *ThermalNetwork* must be provided in the structure as defined
for the .csv reader. The following data is required for applying an
optimisation::

    tree
    ├── pipes.csv                       # (required)
    ├── consumers.csv                   # (required)
    ├── forks.csv                       # (required)
    ├── producers.csv                   # (required)
    └── sequences                       # (optional)
        └── consumers-heat_flow.csv

The attributes, which are required, and which are optional with respect
to the optimisation, are presented in detail in the following:

.. _edges_csv :

Pipes
'''''

The basis for the district heating system optimisation is a table of potential pipes.
The following attributes of the *ThermalNetwork* must be given:

* **id**: see :ref:`Thermal Network <thermal_network_label>`
* **from_node**: see :ref:`Thermal Network <thermal_network_label>`
* **to_node**: see :ref:`Thermal Network <thermal_network_label>`
* **length**: see :ref:`Thermal Network <thermal_network_label>`

The following attributes are additional attributes of the optimisation module.
These attributes are optional for the optimisation:

.. csv-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/opti_edges.csv
   :align: center

* **existing**: Binary indicating an existing pipe. If there is no column
  *existing* given, all Pipes are free for optimisation.
* **capacity**: Capacity of existing pipes.
  If *existing* is *True*, a *capacity* must be given.
* **hp_type**: Label of the type of pipe. The *hp_type* refers to
  a set of parameters of a pipeline component. The parameters for the
  *hp_type* must be given in the following table (see :ref:`network/pipes.csv <invest_pipes>`).
  If *existing* is *True*, a *hp_type* must be given.
* **active**: Binary indicating that this pipe is considered. If no column
  *active* is given, all pipe-options are active. With this attribute, single pipes
  can be switched on and off. This can be very useful, if different scenarios
  should be analyzed, e.g. you might like to make a given street/pipes unavailable.

Consumers
'''''''''

The following attributes of the *ThermalNetwork* must be given:

* **id**: see :ref:`Thermal Network <thermal_network_label>`

The following attributes are additional attributes of the optimisation module, and optional:

.. csv-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/opti_consumers.csv
   :align: center

* **active**: Binary indicating that consumer-xy is considered. If no column
  *active* is given, all consumers are active. With this attribute, single
  consumers can be switched on and off (e.g. for scenario analysis with
  different connection quotes).
* **P_heat_max**: Maximum heat load of consumer. If no column
  *P_heat_max* is given, the maximum heat load is calculated from the heat
  demand series (see `consumers-heat_flow.csv`). Depending on the optimisation
  setting, *P_heat_max* or the demand series is used for the optimisation (see
  :ref:`Optimization settings` for further information).

Producers
'''''''''

The following attributes of the *ThermalNetwork* must be given:

* **id**: see :ref:`Thermal Network <thermal_network_label>`

The following attributes are additional attributes of the optimisation module, and optional:

.. csv-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/opti_producers.csv
   :align: center

* **active**: Binary indicating that producer is active. If no column
  *active* is given, all producers are active. With this attribute, single
  producers can be switched on and off (e.g. for scenario analysis for
  different supply plant positions.

Forks
''''''

The following attributes of the *ThermalNetwork* must be given:

* **id**: see :ref:`Thermal Network <thermal_network_label>`

For Forks, no additional required or optional attributes are needed by the
optimisation module.

Consumers-heat_flow
'''''''''''''''''''

Providing consumers heat flow time series is optional, **but** either the
consumers demand must be given in form of *P_heat_max* as attribute of the
`consumers`, or in form of a heat_flow time series with the minimum length of
1.

The following table shows an example of a `consumers-heat_flow`:

.. csv-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/opti_consumers-heat_flow_example.csv
   :align: center

The column index must be the consumers `id` (And be careful that the `dtype` also matches
the *id* of the consumers!).

.. _add_invest_options :

Investment and additional options
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you want to do an investment or an simple unit commitment optimisation using
the `optimize_investment()` method of the *ThermalNetwork*, you need to provide
some additional data providing the investment parameter.
The following sheme illustrates the structure of the investment input data:

.. include:: ../dhnx/input_output.py
  :start-after: .. _folder_structure_invest:
  :end-before: Parameters

The investment input data provides mainly all remaining parameters of the oemof
solph components, which are not specific for a single pipe, producer or
consumer.

The minimum of required data is a specification of the pipe parameters (costs, and losses), a (heat)
bus and a heat demand at the consumers, and a (heat) bus and a heat source at the producers. The
detailed attributes are described in the following sections.

.. _invest_pipes :

network/pipes.csv
''''''''''''''''''

You need to provide data on the investment options for the piping system. The following table shows
the minimal required data you need to provide:

.. csv-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/opti_pipes.csv
   :align: center

Each row represents an investment option. Note this investment option creates an oemof-solph
*Heatpipeline* component for each active pipe. The units are given es examples. There are no units
implemented, everybody needs to care about consistent units in his own model. At the same time,
everybody is free to choose his own units (energy, mass flow, etc.).

* **label_3**: Label of the third tag. See :ref:`Label system <Label system>`.
* **active**: (0/1). If *active* is 0, this heatpipeline component is not considered. This attribute helps
  for easy selecting and deselecting different investment options.
* **nonconvex**: (0/1). Choose whether a convex or a nonconvex investment should be performed.
  With `nonconvex` set to 1, fix losses and fix costs independent of the
  dimension of the pipelines capacity can be considered. It is recommended to
  set `nonconvex` to 1, as the construction of DHS pipelines is usually
  characterized by a high share of fixed costs.
  If `nonconvex` is 0, the costs-curve is a line through origin.
* **l_factor**: Relative thermal loss per length unit (e.g. [kW_loss/(m*kW_installed)].
  Defines the loss factor depending on the installed heat transport capacity of the
  pipe. The *l_factor* is multiplied by the invested capacity in investment case, and by the given
  *capacity* for a specific pipe in case of existing DHS pipes.
* **l_factor_fix**: Absolute thermal loss per length unit (e.g. [kW/m]).
  In case of *nonconvex* is 1, the *l_factor_fix* is zero if no investement in a specific pipe
  element is done. Be careful, if *nonconvex* is 0, this creates a fixed thermal loss.
  Recommended to use with `nonconvex` is `True`.
* **cap_max**: Maximum installable capacity (e.g. [kW]).
* **cap_min**: Minimum installable capacity (e.g. [kW]). Note that there is a difference if a
  *nonconvex* investment is applied (see `oemof-solph documentation <https://oemof-solph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#investment-optimisation>`_
  for further information).
* **capex_pipes**: Variable investment costs depending on the installed heat transport capacity
  (e.g. [€/kW]).
* **fix_costs**: Fix investment costs independent of the installed capacity (e.g. [€])
  This attribute requires `nonconvex` is set to `True`.

See the *Heatpipeline* API for further details about the attributes.

The module `dhnx.optimization.precalc_hydraulic` provides helpful
functions for the calculation of the pipeline parameters (see :ref:`api_precalc_hydraulic_label`).
See also the precalulation example in the
example folder of the optimisation examples.

.. _Consumer invest data:

consumers/.
'''''''''''

All data for initialising *oemof-solph* components at the consumers are provided by the .csv files
of the consumers folder. For a principal understanding, check out the excel reader example of
*oemof-solph*, which works the same way:
`oemof-solph excel reader example <https://github.com/oemof/oemof-examples/tree/master/oemof_examples/oemof.solph/v0.4.x/excel_reader>`_.

The minimum requirement for doing an DHS optimisation is to provide an demand at the consumers.
Therefore, you need the following two .csv files: *bus.csv* specifies the
*oemof-solph* *Bus* components, and *demand.csv* defines the *oemof.solph.Sink*.

.. include:: ../dhnx/optimization/add_components.py
  :start-after: .. _bus_table:
  :end-before: Parameters

You must provide at least one bus, which has a label
(*label_2*, see :ref:`Label system <Label system>`), and needs to be *active*. Optionally, you can
add an *excess* or a *shortage* with *shortage costs* or *excess costs* respectively. This might
help to get an feasible optimisation problem, in case your solver says, 'infeasible', for finding
the error.

.. csv-table:: demand.csv
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/opti_consumer_demand.csv
   :align: center

The demand also needs to have a label (*label_2*, see :ref:`Label system <Label system>`), has the
option for deactivating certain demands by using the attribute *active*, and needs to have a
specification for the *nominal_value*. The *nominal_value* scales your demand.

producers/.
'''''''''''

The producers look quite similar as the consumers. The consumers are taking energy from the
DHS system. That means, the energy need to be supplied somewhere, which makes some kind of source
necessary. To connect a source in the oemof logic, there needs to be a *oemof.solph.Bus* to which
the source is connected. The two files *bus.csv* and *source.csv* need to be provided:

.. include:: ../dhnx/optimization/add_components.py
  :start-after: .. _bus_table:
  :end-before: Parameters

The *bus.csv* table works analog to the consumers (see :ref:`consumers/. <Consumer invest data>`).

.. csv-table:: source.csv
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/opti_producer_source.csv
   :align: center

You need to provide at least one source at the *source.csv* table. Additionally, there are already a
couple of options for adding additional attributes of the *oemof.solph.FLow* to the source, e.g.
*variable_costs*, *fix* feed-in series, and *min* and *max* restrictions.

Generally, with this structure at every producer and consumer multiple oemof components, like
*transformer* and *storages* can be already added.


.. _Optimization settings:

Optimisation settings
"""""""""""""""""""""

The following table shows all options for the optimisation settings
(See also  :py:func:`~dhnx.optimization.setup_optimise_investment`):

.. csv-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/opti_settings.csv
   :align: center

Some more explanation:

* **heat_demand**: If you set *heat_demand* to `'scalar'`, *num_ts* is automatically 1, and
  the peak heat load is used as heat demand for the consumers. If you want to use a time series as
  heat demand, apply `'series'`.


.. _Label system:

Label systematic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to access the oemof-solph optimisation results, a label systematic containing a tuple
with 4 items is used. Please check the basic example of oemof-solph for using tuple as label
(`oemof-solph example tuple as label <https://github.com/oemof/oemof-examples/blob/master/oemof_examples/oemof.solph/v0.4.x/basic_example/basic_example_tuple_as_label.py>`_).

The following table illustrates the systematic:

.. csv-table:: Labelling system (bold: obligatory; italic: examples)
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/opti_label_sys.csv
   :align: center

The labels are partly given automatically by the oemof-solph model builder:

* **tag1: general classification**: This tag is given automatically depending on the spatial
  belonging. *Tag1* can be either *consumers* (consumer point layer), *producers*
  (producer point layer) or *infrastructure* (pipes and forks layer).
  See :ref:`Thermal Network <TN_Input>`.
* **tag2: commodity**: This tag specifies the commodity, e.g. all buses and transformer
  (heatpipelines) of the DHS pipeline system have automatically the *heat* as *tag2*. For a
  transformer of the consumers or the producers the *tag2* is *None*, because a transformer usually
  connects two commodities, e.g. gas --> heat.
* **tag3: specification / oemof object**: The third tag indicates either the oemof object and is
  generated automatically (this is the case for *demand.csv*, *source.csv* and *bus.csv*),
  or is the specific *label_3* of the *pipes.csv*, *transformer.csv* or *storages.csv*.
* **tag4: id**: The last tag shows the specific spatial position and is generated automatically.

For checking and analysing the results you can either select to write the investment results of the
heatpipeline components in the Thermalnetwork. You will find the results there:

.. code-block:: python

    # pipe-specific investment results
    results = network.results.optimization['components']['pipes']

The following tables provides an overview of the results table:

.. csv-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/opti_results.csv
   :align: center

You can also check out the detailed results of the oemof model, which are stored at:

.. code-block:: python

    # oemof-solph results "main"
    r_oemof_main = network.results.optimization['oemof']

    # oemof-solph results "meta"
    r_oemof_meta = network.results.optimization['oemof_meta']

Or you can also dump the oemof results and analyze the results as described in
`oemof-solph handling results <https://oemof-solph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#handling-results>`_.
The labelling systematic will help you to easily get want you want,
check :ref:`Label system <Label system>`.

The following sections illustrates some features of the DHNx investment optimisation library.

You can execute and reproduce the example with all figures,
check the *introduction_example*.

    import dhnx


    # Initialize thermal network

    network = network.from_csv_folder('twn_data')

                color='tab:green', label='consumers', zorder=2.5, s=50)
    plt.scatter(network.components.producers['lon'], network.components.producers['lat'],

    plt.scatter(network.components.forks['lon'], network.components.forks['lat'],
                color='tab:grey', label='forks', zorder=2.5, s=50)
    plt.text(-2, 32, 'P0', fontsize=14)
    plt.text(82, 0, 'P1', fontsize=14)
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

The following figure shows the initial status of an (thermal)
network, which is examined in the following sections:

.. 	figure:: _static/intro_opti_network.svg
   :width: 75 %
   :alt: intro_opti_network.svg
   :align: center

   Fig. 2: Introduction example

The network of Fig. 2 consists of two options for the heat *producers* ("P0" and "P1"),
eight *consumers*, and 11 *forks*. Before running the whole script, we will have a brief look at
some input data. Let's start with the *consumers.csv* (`"twn_data/consumers.csv"`):

.. csv-table:: consumers.csv
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/intro_consumers.csv
   :align: center

A peak heating load *P_heat_max* is given for every consumer within the thermal network input data
(see :ref:`Thermal Network Input <TN_Input>`). The heat load needs to be pre-calculated, or assumed.
The geographical attributes *lat* and *lon* are optional, but needed for plotting purpose.
The next table shows the input data of the heat pipeline elements
(`"invest_data/network/pipes.csv"`):

.. csv-table:: pipes.csv
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/intro_pipes.csv
   :align: center

In the simplest (and most approximate) case, a linear correlation between the thermal capacity and
the investment costs can be used. In this example, we assume costs of 2 € per kilowatt installed
thermal capacity and meter trench length. As maximum capacity *cap_max*, we take a very high value
to make sure that the total heat load of all consumers (including losses) can be supplied.
Additionally, we assume a heat loss of 0.00001 kW/m. The parameters of the district heating pipes
need to be pre-calculated depending on the piping system and technical data sheet of the
manufacturer. (In future, some pre-calculation function might be added.)
The length of each pipe, the costs and the losses are related to, must be given in the *pipes.csv*
table of the :ref:`Thermal Network Input <TN_Input>`). Next, we optimise the network and get the
results:

.. code-block:: python

    network.optimize_investment(invest_options=invest_opt)

    # get results
    results_pipes = network.results.optimization['components']['pipes']
    print(results_pipes[['from_node', 'to_node', 'hp_type', 'capacity', 'heat_loss[kW]',
                         'invest_costs[€]']])

Since we do not have any other costs than investment costs, we can check if our results have been
correctly processed by comparing the objective of the optimisation problem with the sum of the
investment costs of the single pipes, which should be the same:

.. code-block:: python

    # sum of the investment costs of all pipes
    print(results_pipes[['invest_costs[€]']].sum())

    # objective value of optimisation problem
    print(network.results.optimization['oemof_meta']['objective'])

Next, we can transfer the results to a *ThermalNetwork*, which contains only the pipes with
an investment (to avoid possible numerical inaccuracy, the criterion is > 0.001):

.. code-block:: python

    # assign new ThermalNetwork with invested pipes
    twn_results = network
    twn_results.components['pipes'] = results_pipes[results_pipes['capacity'] > 0.001]

Now, lets have a look at the optimisation results, and plot the pipes:

.. code-block:: python

    # plot invested pipes
    static_map_2 = dhnx.plotting.StaticMap(twn_results)
    static_map_2.draw(background_map=False)
    plt.title('Given network')
    plt.scatter(network.components.consumers['lon'], network.components.consumers['lat'],
                color='tab:green', label='consumers', zorder=2.5, s=50)
    plt.scatter(network.components.producers['lon'], network.components.producers['lat'],
                color='tab:red', label='producers', zorder=2.5, s=50)
    plt.scatter(network.components.forks['lon'], network.components.forks['lat'],
                color='tab:grey', label='forks', zorder=2.5, s=50)
    plt.text(-2, 32, 'P0', fontsize=14)
    plt.text(82, 0, 'P1', fontsize=14)
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()


... which should give:

.. 	figure:: _static/intro_opti_network_results.svg
   :width: 75 %
   :alt: intro_opti_network_results.svg
   :align: center

   Fig. 3: Pipes with investment

The next thing is to deactivate one heat producer by setting the attribute *active* of
producer *P1* to 0 (compare :ref:`Thermal Network Input <TN_Input>`):

.. csv-table:: producers.csv
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: _static/intro_producers_deactive.csv
   :align: center

Now, the plot of pipes with a positive investment should look like this:

.. 	figure:: _static/intro_opti_network_results_2.svg
   :width: 75 %
   :alt: intro_opti_network_results_2.svg
   :align: center

   Fig. 4: Pipes with investment (only *P0*)


There are many other options already implemented. For example:

  * Using time series as heat demand
  * Doing redundancy analysis by setting *min* and *max* attributes to the producers' sources
  * Adding other *oemof-solph* objects like *Transformer*, *Storages*, further *Buses*, *Sinks*
    and *Sources* to each producer and consumer
  * Using discrete pipe data by using the *nonconvex* investment options

Have fun!
