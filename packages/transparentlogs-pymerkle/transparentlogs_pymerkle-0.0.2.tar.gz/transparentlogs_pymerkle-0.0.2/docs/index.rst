************************
Merkle-tree cryptography
************************

This library provides a Merkle-tree implementation in Python. It supports
multiple combinations of hash functions and encding schemas with defense against
second-preimage attack enabled.

Installation
************

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install pymerkle

Usage
*****

.. code-block:: python

  from pymerkle import MerkleTree, verify_inclusion, verify_consistency

  tree = MerkleTree()

  # Populate tree with some entries
  for data in [b'foo', b'bar', b'baz', b'qux', b'quux']:
      tree.append_entry(data)

  # Prove and verify inclusion of `bar`
  proof = tree.prove_inclusion(b'bar')
  verify_inclusion(b'bar', tree.root, proof)

  # Save current state
  sublength = tree.length
  subroot = tree.root

  # Append further entries
  for data in [b'corge', b'grault', b'garlpy']:
      tree.append_entry(data)

  # Prove and verify previous state
  proof = tree.prove_consistency(sublength, subroot)
  verify_consistency(subroot, tree.root, proof)


Security
********

This is currently a prototype requiring security review. However, some steps have been
made to this direction:


Defense against second-preimage attack
--------------------------------------

Defense against second-preimage attack consists in the following standard technique:

* Upon computing the hash of a leaf, prepend its entry with 0x00

* Upon computing the hash of an interior node, prepend the hashes of its
  children with 0x01


Defense against CVE-2012-2459 DOS
---------------------------------

Contrary to the `bitcoin`_ specification for Merkle-trees, lonely leaves are not
duplicated while the tree is growing. Instead, when appending new leaves, a bifurcation
node is created at the rightmost branch. As a consequence,
the present implementation should be invulnerable to the DOS attack reported as
`CVE-2012-2459`_ (see also `here`_ for explanation).


Tree structure
**************

The topology turns out to be that of a binary `Sakura`_ tree.
