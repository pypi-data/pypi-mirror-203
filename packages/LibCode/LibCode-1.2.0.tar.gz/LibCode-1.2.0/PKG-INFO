# Documentation

## Single Node

The SNode class is a simple implementation of a node for a Singly Linked List data structure. Each node in a Singly Linked List contains two attributes: the data it holds and a reference to the next node in the list.

```python
from myLib import SNode
```

Here's a brief explanation of the SNode class attributes and methods:

- Attributes:

1. data: The data the node holds. It can be any data type (e.g., integer, string, object).
2. next: A reference to the next node in the Singly Linked List. The value is None for the last node in the list.

- Methods:

1. **init**(self, data=None): Initializes a new instance of the SNode class with the specified data. By default, the data is set to None.

To create and manipulate nodes using the SNode class, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the SNode class and set the data:

```python
node1 = SNode(1)
```

Create another instance and set the data:

```python
node2 = SNode(2)
```

Link the first node to the second node by setting the next attribute of the first node:

```python
node1.next = node2
```

Now you have two nodes in a Singly Linked List. You can continue adding more nodes and linking them together using their next attribute.

For more advanced operations on a Singly Linked List, such as inserting, deleting, or searching nodes, use the SLL class provided earlier in this conversation.

## Double Node

The DNode class is an implementation of a node for a Doubly Linked List data structure. Each node in a Doubly Linked List contains three attributes: the data it holds, a reference to the next node in the list, and a reference to the previous node in the list.

```python
from myLib import DNode
```

Here's a brief explanation of the DNode class attributes and methods:

- Attributes:

1. data: The data the node holds. It can be any data type (e.g., integer, string, object).
2. next: A reference to the next node in the Doubly Linked List. The value is None for the last node in the list.
3. prev: A reference to the previous node in the Doubly Linked List. The value is None for the first node in the list.

- Methods:

1. **init**(self, data=None): Initializes a new instance of the DNode class with the specified data. By default, the data is set to None.

To create and manipulate nodes using the DNode class, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the DNode class and set the data:

```python
node1 = DNode(1)
```

2. Create another instance and set the data:

```python
node2 = DNode(2)
```

3. Link the first node to the second node by setting the next attribute of the first node and the prev attribute of the second node:

```python
node1.next = node2
node2.prev = node1
```

Now you have two nodes in a Doubly Linked List. You can continue adding more nodes and linking them together using their next and prev attributes.

For more advanced operations on a Doubly Linked List, such as inserting, deleting, or searching nodes, use the DLL class provided earlier in this conversation.

## Tree Node

This TNode class represents a general tree node that can be used for both Binary Search Trees (BST) and AVL trees.

```python
from myLib import TNode
```

The class has several attributes and methods designed to work with tree-based data structures:

- Attributes:

1. data: The data the node holds. It can be any data type (e.g., integer, string, object).
2. balance: The balance factor of the node, used for AVL trees to determine if the tree is balanced or requires rotation.
3. parent: A reference to the parent node.
4. left: A reference to the left child node.
5. right: A reference to the right child node.

- Methods:

1. **init**(self, data=None, balance=0, parent=None, left=None, right=None): Initializes a new instance of the TNode class with the specified data, balance factor, parent, left child, and right child. By default, all values are set to None, and the balance factor is set to 0.
2. Setter methods: set_data, set_balance, set_parent, set_left, and set_right are used to set the corresponding attributes of a TNode instance.
3. Getter methods: get_data, get_balance, get_parent, get_left, and get_right are used to retrieve the corresponding attributes of a TNode instance.
4. **str**(self): Returns the string representation of the node's data.
5. print_node(self): Prints the node's data, balance factor, parent, left child, and right child.

To create and manipulate nodes using the TNode class, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the TNode class and set the data:

```python
node1 = TNode(1)
```

2. Create another instance and set the data:

```python
node2 = TNode(2)
```

Set the parent, left child, and right child of the nodes using the setter methods:

```python
node1.set_right(node2)
node2.set_parent(node1)
```

Now you have two nodes in a tree structure. You can continue adding more nodes and linking them together using their parent, left, and right attributes.

For more advanced operations on BST or AVL trees, such as inserting, deleting, or searching nodes, you would need to create a tree class that utilizes the TNode class to perform those operations.

## Singly Linked List

The SLL class is an implementation of a singly linked list data structure. It provides methods for creating and manipulating singly linked lists. In a singly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node, except for the last node, which has a reference to None.

```python
from myLib import SLL
from myLib import SNode
```

Here's a brief explanation of the methods provided by the SLL class:

1. **init**(self, node=None): Initializes a new singly linked list. You can pass an optional node to set as the head and tail of the list.
2. insert_head(self, node): Inserts a new node at the head of the list.
3. insert_tail(self, node): Inserts a new node at the tail of the list.
4. insert(self, node, position): Inserts a new node at the specified position in the list.
5. is_sorted(self): Checks if the list is sorted in ascending order.
6. sort(self): Sorts the list in ascending order.
7. sorted_insert(self, node): Inserts a new node into the list while maintaining the sorted order.
8. search(self, node): Searches for a node in the list and returns it if found, otherwise returns None.
9. delete_head(self): Removes the head node from the list.
10. delete_tail(self): Removes the tail node from the list.
11. delete(self, node): Removes the specified node from the list.
12. clear(self): Removes all nodes from the list, resetting its size to 0.
13. print(self): Prints the list's length, sorted status, and list content.

To use the SLL class, first, create an instance of the class:

```python
slist = SLL()
```

Then, create nodes and use the provided methods to manipulate the list:

```python
node1 = SNode(1)
node2 = SNode(2)
node3 = SNode(3)

slist.insert_head(node1)
slist.insert_tail(node2)
slist.sorted_insert(node3)

slist.print()
```

This will create a singly linked list with three nodes and print its contents.

You can also use other methods to search, delete, and manipulate the list as needed.

## Doubly Linked List

The DLL (Doubly Linked List) class is an implementation of a doubly linked list data structure. It inherits from the SLL (Singly Linked List) class and extends the functionality to support doubly linked nodes, with each node having a reference to both the next node and the previous node.

```python
from myLib import DLL
from myLib import DNode
```

Here's a brief explanation of the methods provided by the DLL class:

1. **init**(self, node=None): Initializes a new doubly linked list. You can pass an optional node to set as the head and tail of the list.
2. insert_head(self, node): Inserts a new node at the head of the doubly linked list.
3. insert_tail(self, node): Inserts a new node at the tail of the doubly linked list.
4. insert(self, node, position): Inserts a new node at the specified position in the doubly linked list.
5. is_sorted(self): Checks if the doubly linked list is sorted in ascending order.
6. sort(self): Sorts the doubly linked list in ascending order.
7. sorted_insert(self, node): Inserts a new node in the sorted doubly linked list while maintaining its sorted order.
8. search(self, node): Searches for a node in the doubly linked list and returns it if found, otherwise returns None.
9. delete_head(self): Removes the head node from the doubly linked list.
10. delete_tail(self): Removes the tail node from the doubly linked list.
11. delete(self, node): Removes the specified node from the doubly linked list.
12. clear(self): Removes all nodes from the doubly linked list, resetting its size to 0.
13. print(self): Prints the doubly linked list's length, sorted status, and list content.

To use the DLL class, first, create an instance of the class:

```python
dlist = DLL()
```

Then, create nodes and use the provided methods to manipulate the doubly linked list:

```python
node1 = DNode(1)
node2 = DNode(2)
node3 = DNode(3)

doubly_linked_list.insert_head(node1)
doubly_linked_list.insert_tail(node2)
doubly_linked_list.insert(node3, 2)

doubly_linked_list.print()
```

This will create a doubly linked list with three nodes and print its contents.

You can also use other methods to search, delete nodes, and manipulate the doubly linked list as needed.

## Stack

The StackLL class is an implementation of a stack data structure based on a singly linked list. It inherits from the SLL (Singly Linked List) class and disables some of the methods not needed for a stack, such as insert_tail, insert, is_sorted, sort, sorted_insert, delete_tail, and delete.

```python
from myLib import StackLL
from myLib import SNode
```

Here's a brief explanation of the methods provided by the StackLL class:

1. **init**(self, node=None): Initializes a new stack based on a singly linked list. You can pass an optional node to set as the head and tail of the list.
2. push(self, node): Inserts a new node at the top of the stack.
3. pop(self): Removes and returns the top node from the stack. If the stack is empty, it returns None.
4. peek(self): Returns the top node of the stack without removing it.
5. is_empty(self): Checks if the stack is empty. Returns True if the stack is empty, and False otherwise.
6. search(self, data): Searches for a node with the specified data in the stack and returns it if found, otherwise returns -1.
7. clear(self): Removes all nodes from the stack, resetting its size to 0.
8. print(self): Prints the stack's size and content.

To use the StackLL class, first, create an instance of the class:

```python
stack = StackLL()
```

Then, create nodes and use the provided methods to manipulate the stack:

```python
node1 = SNode(1)
node2 = SNode(2)
node3 = SNode(3)

stack.push(node1)
stack.push(node2)
stack.push(node3)

stack.print()
```

This will create a stack with three nodes and print its contents.

You can also use other methods to search, pop, and manipulate the stack as needed.

## Queue

The QueueLL class is an implementation of a queue data structure based on a singly linked list. It inherits from the SLL (Singly Linked List) class and disables some of the methods not needed for a queue, such as insert_head, insert, is_sorted, sort, sorted_insert, delete_head, delete_tail, and delete.

```python
from myLib import QueueLL
from myLib import SNode
```

Here's a brief explanation of the methods provided by the QueueLL class:

1. **init**(self, node=None): Initializes a new queue based on a singly linked list. You can pass an optional node to set as the head and tail of the list.
2. enqueue(self, node): Inserts a new node at the rear (tail) of the queue.
3. dequeue(self): Removes and returns the front (head) node from the queue. If the queue is empty, it returns None.
4. peek(self): Returns the front (head) node of the queue without removing it.
5. is_empty(self): Checks if the queue is empty. Returns True if the queue is empty, and False otherwise.
6. search(self, data): Searches for a node with the specified data in the queue and returns it if found, otherwise returns -1.
7. clear(self): Removes all nodes from the queue, resetting its size to 0.
8. print(self): Prints the queue's size and content.

To use the QueueLL class, first, create an instance of the class:

```python
queue = QueueLL()
```

Then, create nodes and use the provided methods to manipulate the queue:

```python
node1 = SNode(1)
node2 = SNode(2)
node3 = SNode(3)

queue.enqueue(node1)
queue.enqueue(node2)
queue.enqueue(node3)

queue.print()
```

This will create a queue with three nodes and print its contents.

You can also use other methods to search, dequeue, and manipulate the queue as needed.

## Circular Singly Linked List

This CSLL (Circular Singly Linked List) class represents a circular singly linked list data structure that extends the SLL (Singly Linked List) class. A circular singly linked list is similar to a singly linked list, with the only difference being that the last element in the list points back to the first element, forming a loop.

```python
from myLib import CSLL
from myLib import SNode
```

New and overridden methods specific to the CSLL class:

1. insert_head(self, node): Inserts a new node at the head of the list and updates the tail's next pointer to the new head.
2. insert_tail(self, node): Inserts a new node at the tail of the list and updates the tail's next pointer to the head.
3. is_sorted(self): Checks if the list is sorted.
4. sort(self): Sorts the list if it's not already sorted.
5. sorted_insert(self, node): Inserts a new node into a sorted list while maintaining the order.
6. search(self, node): Searches for a node in the list.
7. delete_head(self): Deletes the head node from the list and updates the tail's next pointer.
8. delete_tail(self): Deletes the tail node from the list and updates the tail's next pointer.
9. delete(self, node): Deletes a node from the list.
10. print(self): Prints the list's length, sorted status, content, and the head node to which the tail points back.

To create a circular singly linked list and perform operations using the CSLL class, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the CSLL class:

```python
csll = CSLL()
```

2. Create and insert nodes into the list using the insert_head or insert_tail methods:

```python
node1 = SNode(1)
node2 = SNode(2)
circular_list.insert_head(node1)
circular_list.insert_tail(node2)
```

3. Perform other operations like searching, deleting, or sorting nodes:

```python
circular_list.sort()
found_node = circular_list.search(node1)
circular_list.delete(found_node)
```

4. Print the list:

```python
circular_list.print()
```

The CSLL class provides a basic implementation of a circular singly linked list with essential operations. You can extend the class or add more methods to fit your specific requirements.

## Circular Doubly Linked List

The CDLL class is an implementation of a circular doubly-linked list that inherits from the DLL (Doubly Linked List) class. This class allows you to create and manipulate circular doubly-linked lists. The nodes in the list are connected in a circular fashion, with the tail node pointing to the head node and vice versa.

```python
from myLib import CDLL
from myLib import DNode
```

Here's a brief explanation of the methods provided by the CDLL class:

1. **init**(self, node=None): Initializes a new circular doubly-linked list. You can pass an optional node to set as the head of the list. This method also sets the prev pointer of the head node to the tail node and the next pointer of the tail node to the head node.
2. insert_head(self, node): Inserts a new node at the head of the list.
3. insert_tail(self, node): Inserts a new node at the tail of the list.
4. is_sorted(self): Checks if the list is sorted in ascending order.
5. sort(self): Sorts the list in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
6. sorted_insert(self, node): Inserts a new node into the list while maintaining the sorted order.
7. search(self, node): Searches for a node in the list and returns it if found, otherwise returns None.
8. delete_head(self): Removes the head node from the list.
9. delete_tail(self): Removes the tail node from the list.
10. delete(self, node): Removes the specified node from the list.
11. print(self): Prints the list's length, sorted status, list content, and a loop back to the head.

To use the CDLL class, first, create an instance of the class:

```python
clist = CDLL()
```

Then, create nodes and use the provided methods to manipulate the list:

```python
node1 = DNode(1)
node2 = DNode(2)
node3 = DNode(3)

clist.insert_head(node1)
clist.insert_tail(node2)
clist.sorted_insert(node3)

clist.print()
```

This will create a circular doubly-linked list with three nodes and print its contents.

You can also use other methods to search, delete, and manipulate the list as needed.

## BST Tree

This BST class represents a Binary Search Tree for integer data members. A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure that organizes data in a hierarchical manner, where each node has at most two children, such that the value of the left child is less than the parent node, and the value of the right child is greater than the parent node.

```python
from myLib import BST
from myLib import TNode
```

Here are the methods available in the BST class:

1. **init**(self, arg=None): Initializes the BST with an optional arg which can be a TNode instance or an integer.
2. set_root(self, root): Sets the root of the tree to the given root, which can be a TNode instance or an integer.
3. get_root(self): Returns the root of the tree.
4. insert(self, arg): Inserts a new value into the tree, where arg can be a TNode instance or an integer.
5. delete(self, val): Deletes a value from the tree.
6. search(self, data): Searches for a value in the tree and returns the node if found, otherwise returns None.
7. printInOrder(self): Prints the tree in-order (left, root, right).
8. printBF(self): Prints the tree in Breadth-First (level-order) manner.

To create a BST and perform operations, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the BST class:

```python
bst_tree = BST()
```

2. Insert values into the tree:

```python
bst_tree.insert(10)
bst_tree.insert(5)
bst_tree.insert(15)
```

3. Perform other operations like searching or deleting values:

```python
bst_tree.search(5)
bst_tree.delete(5)
```

4. Print the tree in-order:

```python
bst_tree.printInOrder()
```

## AVL Tree

The AVL class represents a self-balancing AVL tree for integer data members. The class extends the BST (Binary Search Tree) class and overrides the necessary methods for AVL tree behavior. An AVL tree is a binary search tree that automatically balances itself when inserting or deleting nodes to maintain a logarithmic height and achieve optimal searching, insertion, and deletion time complexity.

```python
from myLib import AVL
from myLib import TNode
```

Here are the new and overridden methods specific to the AVL class:

1. **init**(self, arg=None): Initializes the AVL tree.
2. set_root(self, root): Sets the root of the tree.
3. get_root(self): Gets the root of the tree.
4. insert(self, val): Inserts a new value into the tree and balances it.
5. delete(self, val): Deletes a value from the tree.
6. search(self, val): Searches for a value in the tree.
7. printInOrder(self): Prints the tree in-order.
8. printBF(self): Prints the balance factors of the nodes in the tree.
9. balance_tree(self, node): Balances the tree after insertion.
10. find_pivot(self, node): Finds the pivot node and its balance factor.
11. right_height(self, node): Calculates the height of the right subtree.
12. left_height(self, node): Calculates the height of the left subtree.
13. set_balance(self, node): Sets the balance factor of a node.
14. rotate_left(self, pivot, rotator): Rotates the subtree to the left around a pivot node.
15. rotate_right(self, pivot, rotator): Rotates the subtree to the right around a pivot node.
16. create_tree(self, node): Creates a new AVL tree from a given node.

To create an AVL tree and perform operations, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an instance of the AVL class:

```python
avl_tree = AVL()
```

2. Insert values into the tree:

```python
avl_tree.insert(10)
avl_tree.insert(5)
avl_tree.insert(15)
```

3. Perform other operations like searching or deleting values:

```python
avl_tree.search(5)
avl_tree.delete(5)
```

4. Print the tree in-order:

```python
avl_tree.printInOrder()
```

The AVL class provides a basic implementation of a self-balancing AVL tree for integer data members. You can extend the class or add more methods to fit your specific requirements.
