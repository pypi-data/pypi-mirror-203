# ai4sqlite3
**Natural language query assistant for [SQLite databases](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)**

Using a local SQLite3 database file, the command-line interface asks for your query intentions, uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API to formulate SQL fulfilling them, and then runs the SQL on your database. Bring your own [OpenAI API key](https://www.howtogeek.com/885918/how-to-get-an-openai-api-key/) ($ / free trial).

The tool sends your database *schema* and written query intentions to OpenAI. But NOT the result sets nor any other database *content*. The database is opened in read-only mode so that the AI cannot damage it.

### Quick start

<pre>
$ <b>export OPENAPI_API_KEY=xxx</b>
$ <b>pip3 install ai4sqlite3</b>
$ <b>wget https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/raw/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite</b>
$ <b>ai4sqlite3 Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite --yes</b>
Analyzing schema of Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite in 4.9s 

This database models a digital music store. It includes tables for artists, albums,
tracks, genres, media types, invoices, customers, employees, playlists, and playlist
tracks. The tables are linked through foreign keys to form relationships, such as an
artist being associated with an album, an invoice being linked to a customer, and a
playlist being composed of multiple tracks. The database is designed to enable the store
to manage and track music sales, customer information, and employee records, as well as
organizing and categorizing the available music.

Please state the nature of the desired database query.
> <b>top five customer countries by 2011 revenue (round to cents)</b>

Generating SQL in 2.8s 

SELECT c.Country, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) AS 'Revenue 2011'
FROM Customer c
JOIN Invoice i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE strftime('%Y', i.InvoiceDate) = '2011'
GROUP BY c.Country
ORDER BY SUM(i.Total) DESC
LIMIT 5;

    ROUND(SUM(i.Total) / (SELECT SUM(Total) FROM Invoice)*100, 2) AS "North American Revenue Percentage"
FROM 
    Invoice i
    INNER JOIN Customer c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE 
    c.Country = 'USA' OR c.Country = 'Canada';

### Advice

* We reset the AI memory between `Next query?` prompts, so you can't implicitly refer back to prior queries.
* But you can use the up arrow key to recall a prior input to edit or add to.
* If SQLite rejects the AI's SQL, then we automatically request corrections (up to `--revisions` attempts).
* You can (usually) get general questions aswered with something like: *about the schema, what does each invoice line item refer to?*
* You might enjoy exploring your [Firefox](https://www.foxtonforensics.com/browser-history-examiner/firefox-history-location) or [Chrome](https://www.foxtonforensics.com/browser-history-examiner/chrome-history-location) browser history database (you might need to copy the file if your browser has it open).

### Challenging examples

Here are a few examples where gpt-3.5-turbo usually generates erroneous answers (but we show cherry-picked ones).
