Supported Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kayobe supports the following host Operating Systems (OS):

* CentOS Stream 8 (since Wallaby 10.0.0 release)
* Rocky Linux 8 (since Xena 11.1.0 release)
* Ubuntu Focal 20.04 (since Wallaby 10.0.0 release)

.. note::

   CentOS 7 is no longer supported as a host OS. The Train release supports
   both CentOS 7 and 8, and provides a route for migration. See the `Kayobe
   Train documentation <https://docs.openstack.org/kayobe/train/centos8.html>`_
   for information on migrating to CentOS 8.

.. note::

   CentOS Linux 8 (as opposed to CentOS Stream 8) is no longer supported as a
   host OS. The Victoria release will in future support both CentOS Linux 8 and
   CentOS Stream 8, and provides a route for migration.
