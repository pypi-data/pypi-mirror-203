Turbo Docs is a set of command-line utilities made for automating document creation and data entry tasks. Its utilities make it easy to create, package, and distribute Python packages for use by others. The code utilizes Python libraries like requests, openai, click, pyperclip, and redbaron in order to automate data entry tasks, formatting docstrings and wrapping text to 80 characters. The CLI application can generate a README summarizing the code, unit tests and docstrings for Python functions.

## Requirements

- Setuptools library
