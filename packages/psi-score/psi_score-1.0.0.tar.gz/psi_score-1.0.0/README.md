# Psi-score

$\psi$-score: Metric of user influence in Online Social Networks

## Requirements
* Python >=3.9,<3.11

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install psi-score
```

## Usage

```python
>>> from psi_score import PsiScore
>>> adjacency = {0: [1, 3], 1: [0, 2], 2: [0, 1, 3], 3: [0]}
>>> lambdas = [0.23, 0.50, 0.86, 0.19]
>>> mus = [0.42, 0.17, 0.10, 0.37]
>>> psiscore = PsiScore()
>>> scores = psiscore.fit_transform(adjacency, lambdas, mus)
>>> scores
array([0.21158803, 0.35253745, 0.28798439, 0.14789014])
>>> np.round(scores, 2)
array([0.21, 0.35, 0.29, 0.15])
```
You can use another algorithm and change some parameters:
```python
>>> psiscore = PsiScore(solver='power_nf', n_iter=500, tol=1e-3)
>>> scores = psiscore.fit_transform(adjacency, lambdas, mus, ps=[1], qs=[0, 3])
```
The ``ps`` and ``qs`` parameters allows to have some chosen ``p_i`` and ``q_i`` vectors (only with the ``push`` and ``power_nf`` methods):
```python
>>> psiscore.P
{1: array([0.5333334 , 0.1681094 , 0.46801851, 0.34442264])}
>>> psiscore.Q
{0: array([0.46164044, 0.0514935 , 0.02798624, 0.30484491]),
 3: array([0.13087053, 0.01616898, 0.01850541, 0.42554885])}
```
