NALYST



INTRODUCTION

Nalyst is a powerful and user-friendly library designed for data analysts, professionals, and researchers in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for various tasks, such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Decision Trees, Train Test Split, Min Max Scaling, MaxAbs Scaling, and Standard Scaling. With Nalyst, users can quickly and efficiently train, analyze, and evaluate their models, streamlining the entire data analysis process.

FEATURES

Linear Regression: a comprehensive set of tools for building and analyzing linear regression models.

Logistic Regression: a range of tools for building and analyzing logistic regression models.

K-means: a tool for clustering data into k clusters.

PCA: a tool for reducing the dimensionality of data while preserving its most important features.

Decision Tree: a tool for building and analyzing decision trees.

Train Test Split: a flexible and easy-to-use tool for splitting data into training and testing sets.

Min Max Scale: a tool for scaling data to a range of values between 0 and 1.

MaxAbs Scale: a tool for scaling data to the absolute maximum value of each feature.

Standard Scale: a tool for standardizing data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Quick model training: with this library, users can quickly and easily train machine learning models, saving time and effort.


INSTALLATION

To install the library, simply run the following command in your terminal:

pip install nalyst
