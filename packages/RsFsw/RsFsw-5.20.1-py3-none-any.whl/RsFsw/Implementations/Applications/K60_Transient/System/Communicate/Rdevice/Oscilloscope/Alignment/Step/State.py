		Performs the alignment of the oscilloscope itself and the oscilloscope ADC for the optional 2 GHz/ 5 GHz bandwidth
		extension (R&S FSW-B2000/B5000) . The correction data for the oscilloscope (including the connection cable between the
		R&S FSW and the oscilloscope) is recorded. As a result, the state of the alignment is returned. Alignment is required
		only once after setup. If alignment was performed successfully, the alignment data is stored on the oscilloscope.
			INTRO_CMD_HELP: Thus, alignment need only be repeated if one of the following applies: \n
			- A new oscilloscope is connected to the 'IF OUT 2 GHz/ IF OUT 5 GHz' connector of the R&S FSW
			- A new cable is used between the 'IF OUT 2 GHz/ IF OUT 5 GHz' connector of the R&S FSW and the oscilloscope
			- A power splitter is inserted between the 'IF OUT 2 GHz/ IF OUT 5 GHz' connector of the R&S FSW and the oscilloscope
			- New firmware is installed on the oscilloscope or the R&S FSW
		For details see 'Alignment'. \n
			:param step: optional repeated capability selector. Default value: Nr1 (settable in the interface 'Step')
			:return: state: Returns the state of the second alignment step. ON | 1 Alignment was successful. OFF | 0 Alignment was not yet performed (successfully) ."""
