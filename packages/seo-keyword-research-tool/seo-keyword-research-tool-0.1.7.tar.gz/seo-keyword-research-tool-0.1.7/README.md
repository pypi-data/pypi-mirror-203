This tool uses [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/) as a tool to parse data from Google search results. You can use provided API key that will be available after installation, however, it's purely for testing purposes to see if the tool fits your needs. If you'll be using it for your own purpose (personal or commercial), you have to use [your own SerpApi key](https://serpapi.com/manage-api-key).

```

The `--depth-limit` argument for People Also Ask can be set from `0` to `4`. For each depth limit value, the number of results returned grows exponentially. Below is a table showing how the depth limit argument is affected:

| Depth limit | Number of results | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 0 | 4 | Standard results |
| 1 | 12 | 4*2 = 8 + 4 = 12 |
| 2 | 36 | 8*3 = 24 + 12 = 36 |
| 3 | 108 | 24*3 = 72 + 36 = 108 |
| 4 | 324 | 72*3 = 216 + 108 = 324 |

üìåNote: This is how the logic works for the `google.com` domain, on other domains the results may differ.
