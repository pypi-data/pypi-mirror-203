### Important!

Before updating to this version, make sure you have your Alliance Auth updated to
version 2.8.0 (or newer). This version of AA Fleetpings uses a JavaScript library
that is introduced in Alliance Auth 2.8.0, so have your Auth updated before
installing this version.

### Fixed

- MySQL text fields can't have default values
- Parameters differ from overridden method warning

### Added

- Filter to the admin backend
- More checks for Discord. Now check if the Discord Service s actually activated
  and setup properly
- Compatibility to AA Timezones (v1.2.1) new link style
- Backwards compatibility to versions of AA Timezones before 1.2.1, so the old link
  style is still generated when using an older version

### Changed

- Use clipboard.js bundled with Alliance Auth
- Minimum required Alliance Auth version set to 2.8.0 due to us using `clipboard.js`
  bundled with Alliance Auth
- Unused lib removed

### Changed

- Fleet type embed color is now a color picker in admin backend


## [2.2.0] - 2020-09-16

### Added

- Option to use the fittings from the [Fittings and Doctrines](https://gitlab.com/colcrunch/fittings) module if you have it installed


## [2.1.0] - 2020-09-16

### Added

- Restrictions to fleet types
- Restrictions to doctrines


## [2.0.0] - 2020-09-15

This is the official re-brand of AA Discord Ping Formatter, since the original name
didn't fit anymore with the new features, like automatic pings and now the new Slack
implementation.

If you were testing one of the alpha versions of AA Discord Ping Formatter, make
sure to migrate discordpingformatter zero and deactivate the old app in your `local.py`
before activating this one. They will not run side by side.

This is how you do it:
```bash
python manage.py migrate discordpingformatter zero
```
Now remove the `'discordpingformatter',` line and add `'fleetpings',` instead.

Once done, run collectstatic and migrations again. You now have to re-do your
settings in the admin backend, since we just nuked them from the old app.

### Added

- **Support for pings to Slack.** If you're using Slack, simply add
  ``AA_FLEETPINGS_USE_SLACK = True`` to your `local.py`

### Changed

- **!! breaking change !!** Settings are no longer in your `local.py`. You find them
  now in your admin backend. Which means. after installing this version, you _have_
  to re-do your setting in the admin backend of Auth. But trust me, it's worth the
  effort.
- Minimum AA version set to 2.7.4 since we use a feature that was introduced in this
  version. So make sure to update your Alliance Auth before testing this app.

### Fixed

- Several logic errors in JavaScript


## From the discontinued AA Discord Ping Formatter (to keep the history alive)


## [1.1.4] - 2020-08-14

### Fixed

- Little logic error in embedded pre-pings when no FC is set


## [1.1.3] - 2020-08-11

### Fixed

- Single quote issue finally fixed (#31)


## [1.1.2] - 2020-08-10

### Fixed

- Missing "Fleet" on embedded pings headline when no fleet type is selected
- Hopefully escaped possible single quotes in a character name, so they will not be
  transformed into their respective HTML entities in a ping


## [1.1.1] - 2020-08-02

### Changed

- JS modularizing, creation of the link for aa-timezones moved to its own function
- Added a bit more information to the embedded ping, so on mobile phones or system
  notification there is a bit more than just `@everyone` or `@here` to see.


## [1.1.0] - 2020-07-17

### Added

- Configuration for pre-defined fleet comms, formup locations, and doctrines. These
  can be configured in your `local.py` via `AA_DISCORDFORMATTER_FLEET_COMMS`,
  `AA_DISCORDFORMATTER_FLEET_DOCTRINES` and
  `AA_DISCORDFORMATTER_FLEET_FORMUP_LOCATIONS`. See [README](https://github.com/ppfeufer/aa-discord-ping-formatter#fleet-comms-formup-location-and-doctrine) for syntax.


## [1.0.0] - 2020-07-16

### Added

- Restriction for ping targets. Just to make sure not everyone can ping for Capitals
  or even Supers and Titans if these are configured ping targets. (#18)

### Changed

- Set time selection steps to 15 minutes instead of 60 in the datepicker
- Set Monday as the beginning of the week in the datepicker

### Fixed

- Our Australian time travelers and everyone else who lives in the future (UTC+x) are
  now able to pre-ping fleets that are coming up in 2 hours Eve time, which might
  still be in their past local time, depending on how far in the future they live. (#19)


## [0.1.10] - 2020-07-16

### Added

- Option to embed automatic pings via webhook (#13)
- Embedded pings via webhook are now color coded. Pre-defined fleet types are by
  default (Roam = green, Home Defense = yellow, StratOP = orange, CTA = red), and custom
  fleet types can be defined via settings (see [README](https://github.com/ppfeufer/aa-discord-ping-formatter#embed-webhook-pings))

### Changed

- Link to time zones conversion is now a named link

### Fixed

- Missing semicolons in JavaScript found their way back to where they belong


## [0.1.9] - 2020-07-14

### Added

- Ping creator at the end auf automatic pings via webhooks


## [0.1.8] - 2020-07-09

### Added

- Webhook group restrictions. Webhooks can now be restricted to certain groups (see
  [README](https://github.com/ppfeufer/aa-discord-ping-formatter#adding-ping-channels)),
  so not everyone who has access to this module can ping through all webhooks.
  Webhooks without restrictions are accessible for all with access to the module.
  (Thanks to Exiom for bringing this up)
- FC name is pre-filled with the user's main character name, since the user is most
  likely te FC pinging for his own fleet.

### Changed

- Formup Time is now a proper datepicker, so there is a consistent date/time format
  throughout the pings
- Formup Time disabled by default. To enable it, either check the Pre-Ping checkbox
  or disable the Formup NOW checkbox below the Formup Time field
- Formup Time is set to NOW by default


## [0.1.7] - 2020-07-08

### Added

- Link to timezones conversion on formup time if the
  [aa-timezones](https://github.com/ppfeufer/aa-timezones) module is installed


## [0.1.6] - 2020-07-04

### Fixed

- Ping for non-default roles via Webhook (#9)


## [0.1.5] - 2020-06-24

### Added

- Configurable Discord webhooks to ping channels automagically


## [0.1.4] - 2020-06-18
