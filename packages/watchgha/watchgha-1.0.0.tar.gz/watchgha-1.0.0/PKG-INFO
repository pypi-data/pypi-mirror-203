########################
Watch GitHub Action runs
########################

This package provides one command, ``watch_gha_runs``.  It takes a GitHub repo
URL and a branch name, and displays the status of the latest GitHub Action runs
on that branch.  If any of the runs are in progress, it will refresh the
display each second with the current status.

If you like, the name can be pronounced, "Watching? Ha!"


Installation
============

I suggest installing with `pipx`_:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pipx install watchgha

Now you have a command ``watch_gha_runs`` available.  I use a `git alias`_
so that my current repo and branch are implied:

.. code-block:: ini

    [alias]
        runs = "!f() { \
            watch_gha_runs $@ \
                \"$(git remote get-url origin)\" \
                \"$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)\"; \
        }; f"

Now ``git runs`` will show a live display of the current runs on your branch.

You can authenticate against GitHub if needed using either an entry in your
.netrc file, or by setting the ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` environment variable.


Display
=======

The output shows runs and jobs.  The current step of each job is shown, with a
row of bullets indicating the number of steps, and which is current:

Changelog
=========

.. scriv-start-here

1.0.0 — 2023-04-15
------------------

- The ``--poll`` option sets the number of seconds to wait between refreshes.

- Requests to GitHub are now made asynchronously, speeding execution.

- Redirections from GitHub (for example, if a repo is renamed or moved) are
  followed transparently.

- The exit code is now 1 if any runs failed, 0 if all were successful.

- Long lines are no longer wrapped too short.


0.6.0 — 2023-03-22
------------------

- Runs can be selected by a commit SHA by using ``--sha`` on the command line.

- Retry if GitHub returns "502 - Bad Gateway".


0.5.0 — 2023-03-15
------------------

- Uses a ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` environment variable for authentication if it is
  defined.


0.0.2 — 2023-03-14
------------------

- Support more forms of repo URLs: ``git@github.com:``, without ``.git``, etc.

- Better error messages if the repo URL can't be parsed.


0.0.1 — 2023-03-13
------------------

First version

Development
===========

The code is a bit messy and undocumented, and there are no tests.  If you want
to change the code, open an issue and let's talk about it.

Back Story
==========

This started as a formatter for the output of ``gh run list`` from the `gh
run command`_.  Then I tried ``gh run watch``, but wasn't happy with its
choices. So I wrote my own.
