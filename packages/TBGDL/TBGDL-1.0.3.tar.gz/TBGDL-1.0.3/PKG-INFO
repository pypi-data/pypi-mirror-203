# TBGDL
A Python library for creating text-based games.

# Features
tbgdl_print(text, color) - Like print but also adds the ability to color the text. Makes cool ASCII art too!

tbgdl_clear() - Clears the screen.

tbgdl_quit() - Quits the application.

tbgdl_new_scene(command1, command2, command3, command4, command5, command6, command7, command8, command9, command10) - Can only be used in a variable, else that scene can't be referenced anywhere else in your code. If you have empty spaces, replace them up to command10 with 0. tbgdl_getinput() cannot be used in this function.

tbgdl_load_scene(scene) - Loads the variable that you stored your scene in.

tbgdl_playsound(note, sound) - Make beeps with it. The notes need to be in a string, and the sound param is the duration of the beep.
