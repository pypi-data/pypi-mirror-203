# bmgen - Broken Mouse Studios' build solution

## DISCLAIMER
This project is currently in it's beta phase!

It needs to be cleaned up and does not yet have it's full set of features. You may quickly hit it's limits.

You should expect API changes and are welcome to give feedback via https://git.brokenmouse.studio/bms/bmgen/issues

## Features
- build scripts written in Python
- incremental builds
- temporary build directories
- colorful and easy to read output
- simple build commands

## Installation
- Install bmgen via `pip install bmgen` or `python3 -m pip install bmgen`

## Building a simple C project
This example shows a script which builds two files named `main.c` and `game.c` into a binary named `mygame` with `SDL2`.

The following is a breakdown of the script.

1. First import the `clang` command:
```python
from bmgen.commands.clang import clang
```
2. Then set the output directory -- which will also instantly get created -- and tell the `clang` command to create it's object directory inside the output directory:
```python
inst.set_output_dir('bin')
clang.update_object_dir()
```
3. Build the program via `clang`:
```python
clang('mygame', ['main.c', 'game.c'], ['sdl2'])
```

The final `bmgen.py` looks like this:
```python
from bmgen.commands.clang import clang

inst.set_output_dir('bin')
clang.update_object_dir()

clang('mygame', ['main.c', 'game.c'], ['sdl2'])
```

Building the program is now as easy as running `bmgen` in your terminal!
