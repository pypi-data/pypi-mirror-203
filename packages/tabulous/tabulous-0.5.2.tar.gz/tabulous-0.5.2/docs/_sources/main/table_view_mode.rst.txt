To efficiently inspect table data, it is very useful to change table view modes.

Dual View
---------

In dual view mode, table is split into two part and each part can be scrolled
and zoomed independently. This mode is useful to inspect large data.

Dual view is enabled by setting ``table.view_mode = "horizontal"`` for horizontal
view, and ``table.view_mode = "vertical"`` for vertical one.

.. code-block:: python

    table = viewer.add_table(data)
    table.view_mode = "horizontal"

To reset dual view, set the property to ``"normal"``.

.. code-block:: python

    table.view_mode = "normal"

Dual view can also be turned on by key combo :kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`K` ⇒ :kbd:`H` (horizontal) or
:kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`K` ⇒ :kbd:`V` (vertical). Reset it by key combo :kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`K` ⇒ :kbd:`N`.

Popup View
----------

In popup view mode, a large popup window appears and the table data is shown
inside it. This mode is useful when you want to focus on seeing or editing one
table, or the table viewer widget is docked in other widget so it is very small.

Popup view is enabled by setting ``table.view_mode = "popup"`` and can be reset
similar to dual view by ``table.view_mode = "normal"``

.. code-block:: python

    table = viewer.add_table(data)
    table.view_mode = "popup"

Dual view can also be turned on by key combo :kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`K` ⇒ :kbd:`P`.

Tile View
---------

Tile view is a mode that shows different tables in a same window, while the
structure of table list and tabs are not affected.

How tiling works
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For instance, if you tiled tables "A" and "B", they will appear in the same
window, but tabs named "A" and "B" still exist in the tab bar. ``viewer.tables[i]``
also returns the same table as before. When tab "A" or "B" is clicked, the tiled
table with "A" and "B" is shown as ``A|B``.

You can tile the current table and the table next to it by shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`K` ⇒ :kbd:`^`.
You can also programmatically tile tables by calling :meth:`viewer.tables.tile`.

.. code-block:: python

    viewer.tables.tile([0, 1])  # tile the 0th and 1st tables
    viewer.tables.tile([0, 1, 3])  # tile tables at indices [0, 1, 3]

Untiling
^^^^^^^^

Untiling is also well-defined operation. Let's say tabs "A", "B" and "C" is tiled so
these tabs show tiled view ``A|B|C``. If you untiled "B", "A" and "C" are re-tiled
while "B" returns the original state. Therefore, tabs "A" and "C" shows ``A|C`` and
tab "B" shows ``B``.

You can untile the current table by shortcut :kbd:`Ctrl` :kbd:`K` ⇒ :kbd:`\\`.
You can also programmatically untile tables by calling ``viewer.tables.untile([0, 1, 2])``.
