# `relatio`

A Python package to extract underlying narrative statements from text. 

* "relatio" is Latin for "storytelling" (pronounced _reh-LOTT-ee-oh_).
* Motivated, described, and applied in "[Text Semantics Capture Political and Economic Narratives" (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01720).
* Interactive tutorial notebook is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/relatio-nlp/relatio/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb).
* See [here](https://sites.google.com/view/trump-narratives/trump-tweet-archive) for graphical demo of system outputs.

## What can this package do?

1. Identify Agent-Verb-Patient (AVP) / Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) triplets in the text

    - AVPs are obtained via Semantic Role Labeling.
    - SVOs are obtained via Dependency Parsing.
    - A concrete example of AVP/SVO extraction: 
    
    Original sentence: "Taxes kill jobs and hinder innovation."

    Triplets: [('taxes', 'kill', 'jobs'), ('taxes','hinder','innovation')]

2. Group agents and patients into interpretable entities in two ways:

    - Supervised classification of entities. Simply provide a list of entities and we will filter the triplets for you (e.g., ['Barack Obama', 'government', ...]).
    - Unsupervised classification via clustering of entities. We represent agents and patients as text embeddings and cluster them via KMeans or HDBSCAN. The optimal number of topics is data-driven.
    - A concrete example of a cluster:

    Interpretable entity: "tax"  
    Related phrases: ['income tax', 'the tax rates', 'taxation in this country', etc.]

3. Visualize clusters and resulting narratives.

We currently support French and English out-of-the-box. You can also provide us with a custom SVO-extraction function for any language supported by spaCy.

## Installation

Runs on Linux and macOS (x86 platform) and it requires Python 3.7 (or 3.8) and pip.  
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (or conda environment) for the installation.

```bash
# upgrade pip, wheel and setuptools
python -m pip install -U pip wheel setuptools

# install the package
python -m pip install -U relatio
```

In case you want to use Jupyter make sure that you have it installed in the current environment.

## Quickstart
