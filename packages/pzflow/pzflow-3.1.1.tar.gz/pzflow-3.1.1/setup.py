The implementation of the Neural Spline Coupling is largely based on the [Tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/master/tensorflow_probability/python/bijectors/rational_quadratic_spline.py), with some inspiration from [`nflows`](https://github.com/bayesiains/nflows/).\n\nNeural Spline Flows are based on the following papers:\n\n  > [NICE: Non-linear Independent Components Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516)\\\n  > Laurent Dinh, David Krueger, Yoshua Bengio\\\n  > _arXiv:1410.8516_\n\n  > [Density estimation using Real NVP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803)\\\n  > Laurent Dinh, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Samy Bengio\\\n  > _arXiv:1605.08803_\n\n  > [Neural Spline Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04032)\\\n  > Conor Durkan, Artur Bekasov, Iain Murray, George Papamakarios\\\n  > _arXiv:1906.04032_\n',
