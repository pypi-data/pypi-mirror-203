Command line tool to parse md files to espanso config.


## Motivation

As a reviewer at Yandex.Praktikum I have tons of predefined comments for students. It's super uncomfortable to edit in espanso yamls especially, when you need some markdown. So, now I don't have to. This tool will handle it for me.

## Goals
- md files -> yaml in order to maintain 
- espanso match yaml -> md files for people how store their snippets in yamls directly with some basic support of vars feature
