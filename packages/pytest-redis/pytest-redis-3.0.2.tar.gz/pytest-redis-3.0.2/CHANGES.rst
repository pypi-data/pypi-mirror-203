2.4.0
=====

Features
--------

- Import FixtureRequest from pytest, not private _pytest. Require at least pytest 6.2
- Replace tmpdir_factory with tmp_path_factory


2.3.0
=====

Features
--------

- Added datadir configuration that allows to modify the placement of a redis_proc generated files in the specific place.
  This helps overcome the issue with long tmp paths on macosx separately from the temporary path itself.

2.2.0
=====

Features
--------

- Configure redis to listen on specific hostname exclusively using `--bind` parameter.

Misc
----

- rely on `get_port` functionality delivered by `port_for`


2.1.1
=====

Misc
----

- Rise more informative error when the unixsocket is too long. Now the error
  will hint at solution how to overcome it. This might be issue especially on
  MacOS, where the default temp folder is already a long path

2.1.0
=====

Features
--------

- Rely on tmpdir_factory for handling tmpdirs. Now it's cleanup should
  be handled better without much of the leftovers dangling indefinitely
  in the tmp directory.
- Store pidfile in fixture's temporary directory
- Support only python 3.7 and up

Backward incompatibilities
--------------------------

- Dropped `--redis-logsdir` command line option, `redis_logsdir` ini file
  configuration option and `logsdir` fixture factory configuration option.
  Logs will be automatically placed in fixture's temporary directory.
- Dropped `logs_prefix` argument from fixture factory argument

- [feature] ability to configure decode_responses for redis client in command line, pytest.ini or factory argument.
- [bugfix] set decode_responses to False, same as StrictRedis default
- [enhancement] ability to change decode_responses value

1.2.1
=====

- [bugfix] raise specific error in case the redis executable path has been misconfigured or does not exists
