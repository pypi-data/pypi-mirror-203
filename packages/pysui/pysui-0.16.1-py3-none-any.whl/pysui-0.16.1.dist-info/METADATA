# pysui

Python Client SDK for Sui blockchain

## **NOTICE: README FIRST**

**Release-0.16.0**

This `pysui` release introduces **MultiSig** (multiple keyt signing) for extra security governance! A section in the online
documentation has been added to describe the basics.

This `pysui` release introduces **Programmable Transactions** See `pysui/sui/sui_client/transaction.py` It is still being worked. _Note_: The legacy Builders and ease of use API on SuiClient are still available.

We would appreciate any issues being reported in the [github issue log](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/issues)

This is a _**beta**_ release. The degree of changes from 0.27.1 to 0.29.1 and again to 0.31.x are such that we have not completed thorough testing. We wanted to get something out there for users who have moved to 0.31.x devnet or testinet.

The amount of changes have eviscerated the pytest implementations and should not be trusted at this time.

Sui release 0.29.x and 0.31.0 brings **_significant_** breaking changes. Please read the CHANGLOG first as many builders and data models have changed or even been removed. Refer to the [Changes](https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) log for recent additions, changes, constraints, fixes and removals...

- 100% coverage (builders, return types, etc.) for parity with _SUI 0.31.0 API_ on devnet/testnet
  - The fully flexibility of Programmable Transactions are still being worked. Expect changes soon...

**PyPi for 0.16.0**

- [Latest PyPi Version](https://pypi.org/project/pysui/)
