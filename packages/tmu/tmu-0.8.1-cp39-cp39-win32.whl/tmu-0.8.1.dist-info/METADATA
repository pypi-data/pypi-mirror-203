Name: tmu
Version: 0.8.1
Summary: Implements the Tsetlin Machine, Coalesced Tsetlin Machine, Convolutional Tsetlin Machine, Regression Tsetlin Machine, and Weighted Tsetlin Machine, with support for continuous features, drop clause, Type III Feedback, focused negative sampling, multi-task classifier, autoencoder, literal budget,incremental clause evaluation, sparse computation with absorbing exclude, and one-vs-one multi-class classifier. TMU is written in Python with wrappers for C and CUDA-based clause evaluation and updating.
