THIS API WRAPPER IS DEVELOPE BY ME
========

See `clients and api wrappers in the docs <https://defectdojo.github.io/django-DefectDojo/integrations/api-v2-docs/#clients--api-wrappers>`_ for alternatives


DefectDojo API
==============

A Python API wrapper for `DefectDojo <https://github.com/OWASP/django-DefectDojo>`_, an AppSec and Security Vulnerability Management tool.

This package implements API functionality available within Dojo.

Quick Start
-----------

Several quick start options are available:

- Clone the repository: :code:`git clone https://github.com/DefectDojo/defectdojo_api`
- Install with pip (not recommended): :code:`pip install git+https://github.com/DefectDojo/defectdojo_api#master`

- If you are testing the api locally make sure to set the PYTHONPATH. export PYTHONPATH=/path/totheapi/defectdojo_api:$PYTHONPATH

Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    # import the package
    from defectdojo_api import defectdojo

    # setup DefectDojo connection information
    host = 'http://localhost:8000/'
    api_key = 'your_api_key_from_DefectDojo'
    user = 'admin'

    # instantiate the DefectDojo api wrapper
    dd = defectdojo.DefectDojoAPI(host, api_key, user, debug=False)

    # If you need to disable certificate verification, set verify_ssl to False.
    # dd = defectdojo.DefectDojoAPI(host, api_key, user, verify_ssl=False)

    # Create a product
    prod_type = 1 #1 - Research and Development, product type
    product = dd.create_product("API Product Test", "This is a detailed product description.", prod_type)

    if product.success:
        # Get the product id
        product_id = product.id()
        print "Product successfully created with an id: " + str(product_id)

    #List Products
    products = dd.list_products()

    if products.success:
        print(products.data_json(pretty=True))  # Decoded JSON object

        for product in products.data["objects"]:
            print(product['name'])  # Print the name of each product
    else:
        print products.message
