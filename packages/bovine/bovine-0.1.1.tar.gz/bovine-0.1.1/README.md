# Bovine

Bovine is a basic utility library for the FediVerse. It can be used both to build ActivityPub Client applications and ActivityPub Servers. In addition to [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) support, it also provides utilities to deal with [webfinger](https://webfinger.net), nodeinfo, and HTTP Signatures.

The bovine library can just be installed via pip

```bash
pip install bovine
```

Documentation including tutorials is available at [ReadTheDocs](https://bovine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

An entire working ActivityPub server can be found in the [bovine repository](https://codeberg.org/bovine/bovine/).
