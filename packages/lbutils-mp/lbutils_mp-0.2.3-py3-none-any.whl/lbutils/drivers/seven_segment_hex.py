"""Simple hexadecimal driver for a seven-segment display, requiring seven GPIO
pins.

Overview
--------

During initialisation the user must supply a list of exactly seven GPIO pins,
using the numeric pin identifier (e.g. 16 for GPIO Pin 16). Each entry in the
list corresponds to the segment 'a' (for the first entry) to 'g' (for the last
entry). Physically, each LED segment is also assumed to be laid out in the
standard pattern, shown below. Once the constructor has been called, no further
changes are possible: and the driver will also assume exclusive use of the
relevant GPIO pins.

     - A -
   |       |
   F       B
   | - G - |
   E       C
   |       |
     - D -

**Figure 1: Assumed Layout of the Seven Segment Display**

To display a character, the `display` method of the class is used: passing in an
integer in the range 0..F representing the number to show on the seven segment.
Not that by default the `display` method assumes that GPIO pins must be held
_low_ for the segment to display: i.e. the behaviour normally used by common
anode seven-segment displays. If you need the requested GPIO pin to be held
_high_ to display a segment, pass in `True` to the `inverted` parameter of the
`display` method.

!!! Note
    This driver will only display characters in the range '0' to 'F', and
    will raise a `ValueError` exception if the requested character is not in an
    appropriate range.

        ----------

        Parameters
        ----------

        character: int or str
            The value to be displayed on the seven segment display. The value
            must be either a `str` or an `int`, and will be interpreted as
            follows:

            `int`: The value must be between zero ('0') and sixteen decimal
            ('F'), and will be interpreted as a single, hexadecimal digit.

            `str`: The value will be interpreted directly as a hexadecimal digit,
            and must be in the range `[0..F]`.

            If the type does not conform to the above, then a `TypeError` will be
            raised.
        inverted: bool, optional
            By default the `display` method assumes that pulling a GPIO pin _low_
            will turn the relevant segment _on_; i.e. the typical behaviour for a
            common anode display. If the attached display needs to raise a GPIO
            pin _high_ to set the segment _on_ (i.e. the typical behaviour for a
            common cathode display), call the `display` method with `inverted`
            set to `True`.
