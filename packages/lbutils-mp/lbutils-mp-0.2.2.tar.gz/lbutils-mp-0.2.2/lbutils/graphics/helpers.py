### Classes

class Pen:
    """Implements a convenience class for the graphics library, which represents
    a 'pen' with a specified foreground and background colour, and thickness.
    The primary purpose of this class is to make it easy to swap between common
    colour and line values; for instance using two pens to allow a swap between
    'highlight' and 'normal' text colours. This can be accomplished by defining
    the foreground and background colour of the
    [`Canvas`][lbutils.graphics.canvas] as needed: this class simply makes that
    switch easier.

    Example
    -------

    Two new pens can be defined for 'normal' and 'alert' text as

    ````python
    normal_text = Pen(COLOUR_WHITE)
    alter_text = Pen(COLOUR_RED)
    ````

    This defines a `normal_text` pen with a white foreground and default
    background and line thickness (black and 1 pixel byt default). A second pen
    for `alter_text` has a red foreground, and similarly a black background with
    1 pixel thickness. Text can then be written on the canvas using these two
    pens on a `Canvas` as

    ````python
    canvas = Canvas(width = 96, height = 48)

    canvas.write_text(0, 10, "This is normal text", pen = normal_text)
    canvas.write_text(0, 20, "and this is alert", pen = altert_text)
    canvas.write_text(0, 30, "Now everything is back to normal", pen = normal_text)
    ````

    Attributes
    ----------

    bg_colour: Type[Colour], optional
            The background colour of the pen. Defaults to black.
    fg_colour: Type[Colour], optional
            The foreground colour of the pen. Defaults to white.
    thickness: int, optional
            The line thickness of the pen. Defaults to 1 pixel.

class Pixel:
    """Represents a Cartesian co-ordinate. Used as a convenience class for
    instances such as cursors where a relationship between a X and a Y co-
    ordinate must be maintained. This is also useful when two or more co-
    ordinates need to be tracked, or to be switched between. For instance an
    'origin' co-ordinate for a drawing, and a 'current' co-ordinate around the
    origin where lines are being drawn to and from.

    !!! note "Implementation Defined Origin"
            As for the [`Canvas`][lbutils.graphics.canvas] class, the
            interpretation of the point '(0, 0)' is defined by the underlying
            graphics implementation. For instance the '(0, 0)' point may
            represent the top-left corner or the canvas, or the bottom- left hand
            corner. For details of how this point will be chosen (or changed),
            see the implementation of the specified sub-class of `Canvas` that is
            implemented by the chosen display driver.

    Attributes

class BoundPixel(Pixel):
    """Represents a Cartesian co-ordinate between limits. Used as a convenience
    class for instances such as cursors where a relationship between a X and a Y
    co-ordinate must be maintained. This is also useful when two or more co-
    ordinates need to be tracked, or to be switched between. For instance an
    'origin' co-ordinate for a drawing, and a 'current' co-ordinate around the
    origin where lines are being drawn to and from.

    Unlike the [`Pixel`][lbutils.graphics.Pixel] class, the `BoundPxiel` will
    also ensure that the X and Y co-ordinates are maintained between minimum and
    maximum value for the `width` or `height`. This is useful for instances where a
    cursor, for instance, must only take values within the limits of a display. It
    can also be used where a clipping region is being defined to ensure that values
    cannot lie outside the clipped region.

                ordinates to the specified limits. If set to `False`, instead
                raise a `ValueError` if the `x` or `y` co-ordinates do not fall
                into the allowed limits.

        Implementation
        --------------

        As the `x` and `y` attributes of this class are compared on each write,
        this class is by definition slower and potentially more resource intensive that
        the underlying `Pixel` class. If the costs of the bounds-check are not required,
        using the 'raw' `Pixel` class may be preferable.

        !!! note
                The parameter order is specified to allow easier definition
                in the common case where the lower limits for `x` and `y` are
                `0`, and the positional parameter order is being used. If all
                four limits are being used, consider the use of named
                parameters to avoid ambiguity.
