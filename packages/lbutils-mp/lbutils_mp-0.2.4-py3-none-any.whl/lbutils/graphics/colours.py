"""Implements a helper library and `Colour` class which holds the internal
colour representations used by the graphics library. The `Colour` class aims to
achieve three goals.

1. To hold the internal (byte) representations of colours typically used by
small OLED and LED screens.
2. To convert between those internal representations, trading off space for
colour accuracy for instance
3. To provide a simple interface for the graphics library (and graphics routines)
which can make use of the colour representations: and without having to replicate
the detailed bit manipulation that colour storage and conversion involves.

## Colour Reference

In addition to the `Colour` class, a list of 16 'VGA' colours defined in the
HTML 4.01 specification is also provided. These provide common, named, colour
representations suitable for most displays, for instance as

````python
import lbutils.graphics as graphics

fg_colour = graphics.COLOUR_CYAN
````

A complete list of the 16 objects defined by the `lbutils.colours` module is
shown below

class Colour:
    """A (packed) representation of a colour value, as `r` (red), `g` (green)
    and `b` (blue) components. The principle purpose of this class is to both
    hold the internal representation of the colour; and to make the manipulation
    of those colour values in other graphics routines as straightforward as
    possible.

    Attributes
    ----------
    bR: int, read-only
        The byte (`0..255`) of the red component of the colour
    bG: int, read-only
        The byte (`0..255`) of the green component of the colour
    bB: int, read-only
        The byte (`0..255`) of the blue component of the colour
    as_565: int, read-only
        Provides the colour value in the RGB565 format, using a single
        byte in the the standard platform representation.
    as_888: int, read-only
        Provides the colour value in the RGB888 format, using a
        double word for the colour value in the standard platform
        representation.
    bit_order: DEVICE_BIT_ORDER, read-write
        Argument indicating if the underlying bit order used for
        the bit packing order in colour conversions. Defaults to
        `ARM` as set by the default constructor.

    Implementation
    --------------

    Where possible attribute values are cached, and so the first
    call of the attribute will be slightly slower than subsequent calls.

    !!! warning "Immutable Class"
        To ensure the accuracy of the returned value, the Colour is also
        assumed to be immutable once the constructor has completed. If
        the private (non-public) attributes are modified outside the
        constructor the behaviour of the class is undefined.

        attributes will determine the representation used when displaying the
        colour.
