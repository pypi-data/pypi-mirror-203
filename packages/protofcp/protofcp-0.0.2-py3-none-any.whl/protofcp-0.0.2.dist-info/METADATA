# FCP

**FCP** stands for **Fast Channel Protocol**, a protocol used to route on "**channels**" and send or receive data. 

This protocol does not use a **buffer**, which is specially designed for local network addresses for a camera/audio device connection.

This protocol **has much the same function as radio frequencies**, unlimited clients can send/receive information without physical addresses.



## How to install:



`pip install protofcp`



## Send message in channel 1:

```python

import protofcp



sock = protofcp.FCPSocket(protofcp.Channels.CHANNEL_01)

while True:

    msg = input("> ")

    sock.send(msg.encode())

```



## Receive message in channel 1:

```python

import protofcp



sock = protofcp.FCPSocket(protofcp.Channels.CHANNEL_01)

msg = sock.recv()

print(msg)

```
