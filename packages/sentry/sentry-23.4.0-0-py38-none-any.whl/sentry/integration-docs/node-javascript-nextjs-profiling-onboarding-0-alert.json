If you have any questions or feedback, join our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/zrMjKA4Vnz\">discord channel</a>.\n<p>Note that only nextjs server side profiling is supported, client side (browser profiling) is not supported and you will need to make sure you only enable profiling in <code>sentry.server.config.js</code> file.</p>\n</div>",
