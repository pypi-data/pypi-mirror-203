"""Perform functionality for synchronizing and resetting with a repo.

get_supported_platforms - Get a list of all data platforms supported currently
smart_sync - Synchronizes all local files with a remote repository through user input
reset_all - Completely resets both local and remote repos with user input confirmation

  Typical usage example (for S3):

  import s3synchrony as s3s
  params = {}
  params["datafolder"] = "Data"
  params["aws_bkt"] = "analytics_development"
  params["aws_prfx"] = "S3_Synchrony_Testing"
  if(len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == "reset"):
      s3s.reset_all(**params)
  else:
      s3s.smart_sync(**params)
