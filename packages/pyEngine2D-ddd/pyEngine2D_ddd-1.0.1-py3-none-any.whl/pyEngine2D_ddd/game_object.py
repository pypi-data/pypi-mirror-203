	 	screen: default value contains the instance of the pygame screen defined in main
   		transform: contains the Vector2D(x,y) screen coords for the image to be loaded
	 	scale: contains the Vector2D(x,y) scale amount with 1 being default pixel size
	 	rotation: contains a int of the degrees to rotate the image from up and down
   		parent: string with the name of the game object to inherit Transform from.
   		packages: a list of strings for file names you want to import
		last_scale: int of scale from last frame to reduce operations per frame
		last_parent_scale: int same as last_scale but for the parent object if there is one
		image_start: screen image of the sprite entered with 0 rotation and 1 scale modified each frame.
		package_instances: list of instances of classes loaded from packages entered in args
		packages_import: temporary list of imported packages from scripts folder to be instantiated
