    .. tab-item:: API Wrapper (Pycord)

        This framework uses a Discord API wrapper called PyCord and it is built to allow working directly with Pycord (eg. framework objects accept Pycord objects as arguments).

Key features
----------------------
- Ability to run on **multiple** accounts at once, either on a personal account or as **normal bot** account.

.. caution::
    While running this on user accounts is possible, it is :strong:`not recommended` since it is against Discord's ToS.
    I am not responsible if your account get's disabled for using self-bots!

- Periodic advertisement to different channels,
- Login with username/password - :ref:`Automatic login`,
- Automatic guild discovery and join - :ref:`Automatic guild discovery and join`,
- Logging of sent messages (including SQL) - :ref:`Logging`
- Async framework
- Easy to setup, with minimal code
