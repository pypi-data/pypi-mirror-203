URGENCY: to do soon
--------------------


--------------
URGENCY: high
--------------

- FFmpeg warns: for the new versions `-vsync` arg is deprecated, use `fps_mode`.
  This is related to `video_to_sequences.py`, `concatenete.py`, but for
  backwards compatibility reasons I will keep the  '-vsync' argument for a
  while longer because fps_mode does not work with old versions of FFmpeg.
  So, vsync's warning is just a warning and still works with the new versions.

---------------
URGENCY: medium
----------------
- If you plan to refactor code and make it compatible only for
  wx.Python4.1.1/wxPython4.2.0:
  - then erase `TestListCtrl` class on youtubedl_ui.py. Also check all code that
    starts with wx.version().
  - erase
        try:
            from wx.svg import SVGimage
        except ModuleNotFoundError:
            pass

  However, note that these operations leads to make Videomass code incompatible
  for wxPython4.0.7.

URGENCY: low (New implementations)

- [PRESETS MANAGER] The profile requires additional input (-i FILE -i FILE ...)
- @johannesdedoper would like a function to save some UI settings, see #113 .
