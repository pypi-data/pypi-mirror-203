Description: # NOTIP: Non-parametric True Discovery Proportion control for brain imaging
        
        This repository contains the code to reproduce all experiments of the Notip paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10572). The scripts directory contains a script per figure.
        Note that the first time you run one of those scripts, the fMRI data fetching from Neurovault will take place, which takes a significant amount of time. This only needs to be done once.
        
        ### Installing dependencies
        
        ```
        python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ### Reproducing figures
        
        To reproduce any figure, i.e. figure 2, run:
        
        ```
        python figure_2.py
        ```
        This will display the corresponding figure as well as save it in ../figures
        
        ### Parallelization
        
        To speed up any script using parallelization on CPU cores, use:
        
        ```
        python figure_2.py 6
        ```
        
        With any number of CPU cores instead of 6.
