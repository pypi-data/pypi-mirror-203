Description: # fkeycapture
        This is a simple and easy to use package that allows you to capture individual keystrokes from the user.
        #### Forms:
        1. (Default) Recive key as a string
        2. Recive key as bytes (get only)
        3. Recive key as ints  (getnum only)
        #### How to Use:
        1. from fkeycapture import get, getnum, getchars
        2. Use get like this: get([number of keys to capture],[if you want bytes output, make this 'True'])
        3. Use getnum like this: getnum([number of numbers to capture], [if you want int output, make this `True`])
        ###### v.1.2.1:
        Type hinting, docstrings, and int support for getnum!
