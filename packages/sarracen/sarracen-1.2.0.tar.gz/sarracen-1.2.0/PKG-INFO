Sarracen
========

A Python library for smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) analysis and visualization.

About
-----

Sarracen is built upon the pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy libraries. It can load SPH particle data into a pandas DataFrame object that has been extended to allow for rendering of particle data and interpolation of particles to fixed grids. Additionally, this allows for access to the rich landscape of Python scientific and statistical libraries. All SPH functions offer multi-threaded CPU and CUDA implementations. Our intended application is for astrophysical SPH data. 

Installation
------------

The latest stable release and associated dependencies can be installed from PyPi:

    pip install sarracen

This is the recommended way to install Sarracen.

To install the latest development snapshot, install using this GitHub repository. Either clone the repository and add it to your path so that it can be imported, or install directly through pip:

    pip install git+https://github.com/ttricco/sarracen.git
