Before engaging in the development of a story or task ensure that the plan of attack is clearly broken down and that each deliverable is clearly defined 
in a development plan specification. Be sure to identify which tasks or issues are being discussed, and to outline a testing strategy. The document may be structured as needed; however, it must include a description of every class, function, and module; the purpose for including every class function and module; and the unit testing strategy for every function. 

You can look at the desctriptions and purpose ad the content that will be commented in the docstrings of the source code. Include parameters, types, and return types.
