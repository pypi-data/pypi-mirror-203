# PyIntellect
A CPythonic Python code obfuscation tool.
The usage will be via a command line interface.

## Features

- Single file obfuscation (currently limited to 5kb files until licenses are implemented)
- Module obfuscation (currently limited to 5kb files until licenses are implemented)
- Remove all comments
- Anti Python debugger
- Anti importing debugging packages
- Rename functions and classes
- Turn comments starting with `# pyintellect` into code. E.g. `# pyintellect print("test")` turns into `print("test")`.

## Planned Features / To Do
- Multiple modes of obfuscation (single file, with modules, etc.)
- Expire after a certain date

## Specialities
- PyIntellect preserves the __name\_\_ attribute.
- PyIntellect obfuscated files have a significant speed boost compared to other obfuscators.
