              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
              exercising permissions granted by this License.
        
              "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
              including but not limited to software source code, documentation
              source, and configuration files.

              transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

==========
Cortex CLI
==========

Command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with an IQM quantum computer.

Installing Cortex CLI
---------------------

Requirements for installing:

- Python 3.9
- `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install iqm-cortex-cli

Using Cortex CLI
----------------

For general usage instructions, run

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cortex --help

Initialization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, Cortex CLI needs initialization, which produces a configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cortex init

Cortex CLI will ask a few questions. You can also pass the values via command line to avoid having an interactive
prompt. See ``cortex init --help`` for details.

Login
^^^^^

To log in, use

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cortex auth login

This will ask you to enter your username and password.

After a successful authentication, tokens will be saved into a tokens file (path specified in the configuration file),
and a token manager daemon will start in the background. Token manager will periodically refresh the session and
re-write the tokens file.

To use the token manager in a foreground mode (not as daemon), run ``cortex auth login --no-daemon``. This requires
keeping the shell session alive. However, you can start the process in the background by adding ``&`` after the
command: ``cortex auth login --no-daemon &``. This applies to Bash, zsh and similar shells, but may not be available
on all shells.

To login and get tokens once, without starting a token manager at all, run ``cortex auth login --no-refresh``.

If the tokens file already exists, then running ``cortex auth login`` will first attempt to refresh the session without
asking you for a username and password. If that fails (because existing tokens may already have expired), you'll be
asked to re-enter your credentials.

See ``cortex auth login --help`` for more details.

Use with Cirq on IQM, Qiskit on IQM, etc.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adapters based on IQM Client, such as Cirq on IQM and Qiskit on IQM, can take advantage of the tokens file maintained by
Cortex CLI. This way you won't need to provide the authentication server URL, username, or password to the adapter
library itself. To achieve this, follow the instructions printed on the screen after running ``cortex auth login``.
Namely, set the ``IQM_TOKENS_FILE`` environment variable to point to your tokens file, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ export IQM_TOKENS_FILE=/home/user/iqm_tokens.json

Once set, this environment variable is read by the instance of IQM Client associated with the adapter. As a result,
from the point of view of the adapter it looks like authentication is simply not required (i.e. no
authentication-related information has to be provided to the adapter).

Status
^^^^^^

To see the current status of the token manager, use:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cortex auth status

If the tokens file exists, ``cortex auth status`` will report whether the corresponding token
manager is running. It will also print the time of the last successful refresh request, and
how much time is left until current tokens expire.

See ``cortex auth status --help`` for more details.

Logout
^^^^^^

To log out, run

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cortex auth logout

This will send a logout request to the authentication server, kill the token manager daemon (if any), and delete the
tokens file.

You may want to stop the token manager, but maintain the session on the server and keep the tokens file intact.
To do so, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cortex auth logout --keep-tokens

See ``cortex auth logout --help`` for more details.

Multiple configuration files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, all Cortex CLI commands read the configuration file from the default location
``~/.config/iqm-cortex-cli/config.json``. You can specify a different filepath by providing the ``--config-file`` value,
for example:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cortex auth status --config-file /home/joe/config.json
  $ cortex auth login --config-file /home/joe/config.json
  $ cortex auth logout --config-file /home/joe/config.json


Using Cortex CLI for circuits
-----------------------------

Circuit-related commands require additional dependencies to be installed. To install them, run

.. code-block:: bash

  $ pip install "iqm-cortex-cli[circuit]"

Circuit validation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cortex circuit validate my_circuit.qasm

validates the quantum circuit in file ``my_circuit.qasm``, and reports errors if the circuit is not
valid OpenQASM 2.0. The exit code is 0 if and only if the circuit is valid.

Executing circuits on a quantum computer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can execute a quantum circuit on an IQM quantum computer with

.. code-block:: bash

  $ export IQM_SERVER_URL="https://example.com/iqm-server"
  $ cortex circuit run --shots 100 --qasm-qubit-placement my_qubit_placement.json my_circuit.qasm

The server URL can be set either with command-line option or as an environment variable.

By default, authentication is handled the same way as with other Cortex CLI commands. You can
override this and provide your own server URL, username, and password by setting environment
variables IQM_AUTH_SERVER, IQM_AUTH_USERNAME and IQM_AUTH_PASSWORD.

Note that the circuit needs to be transpiled so that it only contains operations natively supported by the IQM quantum
computer you are using.

For information on all the parameters and their usage, run

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cortex circuit run --help


The results of all the measurements in the circuit can be returned in human-readable or machine-readable format:

``--output frequencies`` provides a human-readable output of the measurement frequencies, this is the default format:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cortex circuit run --output frequencies --shots 5000 --iqm-json ./tests/resources/valid_circuit_2.json
  Circuit "My Circuit" results using calibration set 41 over 5000 shots:
