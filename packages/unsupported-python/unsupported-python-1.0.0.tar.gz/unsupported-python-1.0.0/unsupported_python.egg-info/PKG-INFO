unsupported-python
==================

This package can be used as a conditional dependency to indicate lack of
support for particular versions of Python.

```toml
[project]
name = "my-test-package"
version = "1.0.0"
dependencies = [
    # package does not work on Python 3.11 and beyond
    "unsupported-python; python_version>='3.11'",
]
```

Installing a package which depends on `unsupported-python` will fail with an
error message, without breaking the installation further by going back to
earlier versions of said package.

To allow installation of the `unsupported-python` dependency, and hence any
package that conditionally depends on it, set the `ALLOW_UNSUPPORTED_PYTHON`
environment variable to any value.
