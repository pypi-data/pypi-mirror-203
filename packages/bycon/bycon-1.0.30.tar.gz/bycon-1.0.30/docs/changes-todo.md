## Changes

### 2023-04-14 (v1.0.30)

* added `plot_utils.py` and `plot_defaults.yaml`; now there is a first method
  for plotting histograms
    - so far limited to CNV histograms of many or few whole chromosomes from
      pre-computed frequencymaps
    - no separate sevice so far; can be invoked from the `intervalFrequencies`
      service with added `&output=histoplots` pragma
    - so far no marker addition etc.

### 2023-04-12 (v1.0.29)

* fixed broken dataset selection (bug introduced w/ v1.0.28)
* moved dataset parsing to separate library `lib/dataset_parsing.py`

### 2023-04-11 (v1.0.28)

* fixed the filter processing where "correctly looking but not existing" filter
  patterns were pruned from the query instead of being kept & leading to a mismatch
* added 2 types of warnings for such cases:
    - undefined filter pattern
    - correct pattern but value not in database

### 2023-03-31 (v1.0.27)

* FIX: `ids` service (and therefore identifiers.org resolver) was broken due to custom & degraded config path

### 2023-03-31 (v1.0.26)

* removal of VRS classes since VRS is about to switch to EFO
* added `EFO:0020073: high-level copy number loss` from the upcoming EFO release
* adding `examplez` dataset definition

### 2023-03-30 (v1.0.25)

Bug fix release:

* fixed `output=text` errors
* some argument parsing bugs that crept in with last release
* library re-shuffling w/ respect  to `byconaut`

### 2023-03-27 (v1.0.24)

* added `output=vcf` option for variant export & made it default for the 
`phenopackets` entity
    - VCF export is basic & hasn't been tested for round trip compatibility
* added filter exclusion flag:
    - for POST a Boolean `"excluded": true`
    - for GET prefixing a term by an exclamation mark (e.g. `!PATO:0020002`)
    - this is a **BeaconPlus** feature - see [issue #63](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2/issues/63) in `beacon-v2` 

### 2023-03-02 (v1.0.22)

* v1.0.22 fixes the `testMode=True` call

### 2023-02-05

* `bycon` now available as Pypi package
    - `pip install bycon`

### 2023-01-15

- [x] create bycon documentation subdomain & configure Github pages for it  

## Bugs & TODO

* [x] fix filter queries for correct no-match:
    - query type indicates that the filter is "collationed"
    - query_generation looks for term in collations to perform term expansion
    - BUG: if term is not found -> currently term is not added to final query
      object -> query is only based on other parameters
* [x] disentangle general configurations, resources (which stay with the package)
  and instance-specific ones and load them from their appropriate locations
    - `beaconServer` and `services` scripts need to (over-) load from configs
      within their directories
    - this is in principle already possible, just need disentanglement etc.
* [ ] Data: fix publication data for consequent inclusion of `ISO3166alpha2` codes
* [ ] fix publications.py default filters "PMID" and "genomes:>0"
