    description: (from Phenopackets v.2) Flag to indicate whether the disease was
      observed or not. Default is ‘false’, in other words the disease was observed.
      Therefore it is only required in cases to indicate that the disease was looked
      for, but found to be absent. More formally, this modifier indicates the logical
      negation of the OntologyClass used in the 'featureType' field. CAUTION It is
      imperative to check this field for correct interpretation of the disease!
