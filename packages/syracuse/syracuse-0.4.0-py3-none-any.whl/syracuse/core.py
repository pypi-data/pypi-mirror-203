class Syracuse():
	"""
	A (full) Collatz sequence instanciated with a given initial value.
	
	The instance is iterable, and gives the successive values of the Collatz sequence.
	
	!!! example
	
		```python linenums="1"
		syracuse = Syracuse(1000)
		for value in syracuse:
			print(value)
			if value == 1:
				break
		```
	
	Be aware that a Collatz sequence is infinite: once it reaches 1 (and that is apparently the case for all tested initial values until now !), the cycle 4,2,1 returns indefinitely. So make sure you have implemented a stopping condition when you iterate over the sequence.
	
	For each sequence an underlying, directional graph is implemented, and is populated the first time several attributes are read (like `total_stopping_time`, `max` and of course `graph` and `graph_view`), resulting an additionnal computing duration, that can be noticeable on "big" sequences. But the duration becomes imperceptible next times those attributes are read.
	
	Furthermore, a "global" graph can be optionaly initialized, and is shared with all instances. It is basically useful when working on a large number of sequences, or on same sequences repeatedly. If a global graph population is asked for a sequence instantiation, then the local graph is deduced from it only when needed, and stored in a class attribute for further use. Be aware that the global graph activation generates a significant amount of additional memory storage, but on the other side the computation speed is generally highly improved.
	
	Parameters:
		initial:
			Initial value of the Collatz sequence. Must be strictly positive.
		populate_global_graph:
			If `True`, a global graph is built, and populated with the graph of the current sequence. Default is `False`
	
	Attributes:
		initial_value:
			Reminder of the initial value given for the sequence initialisation. **read-only**
		stopping_time:
			The smallest rank such that the value becomes lower than the initial one. **read-only**
		total_stopping_time:
			The smallest rank such that the value equals 1. **read-only**
		total_stopping_sequence:
			Tuple of the sequence from the initial value, to 1. **read-only**
		max:
			Maximum value of the sequence. **read-only**
		max_rank:
			Rank of the maximum value of the sequence. **read-only**
		graph_view:
			A dict-like structure representing the graph of the successive members of the current sequence. **read-only**
		graph (networkx.Digraph):
			The underlying, directional graph for the current Collatz sequence. **read-only**
		global_graph (networkx.Digraph):
			The global graph shared with all sequences, gathering in the same graph all sequences' graphs instanciated with `populate_global_graph = True`. **read-only**
		single_graphs (dict[networkx.Digraph]):
			Store the graphs generated for a single sequence to avoid repeated computations of the same graph (used only if `populate_global_graph` is `True`)
		
	Raises:
		ValueError:
			Raises if `initial` is not a strictly positive integer.

		To populate the graph, this function temporarly instanciates the needed Syracuse objects, that can cause lot of memory consumtion; nevertheless each instance are deleted before the initialization of the next one.
		The resulting graph is stored in the class attribute `global_graph`, and is returned by this function too for convenience.
		
		It is possible to switch to an alternative computation algorithm, using the ability of the computer/OS to execute simultaneous tasks. Depending on the hardware (ie: number of "cores" of the CPU), the benefit can be really interesting for a large range of values (the definition of "large" depends heavily on your configuration). For the most little ranges, it is better to use the classical, sequential approach.

		| 1           | Usage of `multiprocessing.Process` objects: each process computes a part of edges and nodes of the global graph as shared objects, and the global graph is built in the parent process once all edges and nodes are ready.|
		| 2           | Usage of `multiprocessing.Process` objects: each process computes its own part of the global graph, and the full global graph is later gathered in the parent process. |
		
		Parameters:

			max_initial_value:

			excludes:
