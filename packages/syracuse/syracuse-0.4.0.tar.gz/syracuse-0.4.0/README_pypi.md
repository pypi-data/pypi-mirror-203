# Syracuse

syracuse, The Syracuse problem (aka Collatz conjecture) library.

## About the project

The syracuse library provides a way to generate Collatz sequences (either "normal" or compressed forms) and some functions to deal with.

### The Collatz conjecture

The Collatz conjecture, also known as the "3n + 1 problem" or the "Syracuse problem", is an unsolved hypothesis in mathematics that concerns a sequence of operations applied to a positive integer. The conjecture states that no matter what the starting value of this integer is, the sequence will always eventually reach the value 1.

More specifically, the Collatz conjecture states that if one takes a positive integer n and applies the following function:

- If n is even, divide it by 2.
- If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.

Then, repeat the process with the resulting value, applying the function over and over again until the value of n eventually reaches 1.

> For example, if one takes n = 6, the sequence for the Collatz conjecture would be:
> 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Although the conjecture has been computationally tested for extremely large values, it remains unproven to this day.

### The compressed form

*(definition partially inspired by the [relevant article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture))*

Since 3n+1 is even whenever n is odd, one may instead use the "compressed" form of the Collatz function:

- if n is even, divide it by 2.
- if n is odd, multiply it by 3, add 1 **and divide the result by 2**.

This definition yields smaller values for the stopping time and total stopping time without changing the overall dynamics of the process. 

> For example, consider the Collatz sequence for the number 17:
> 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
>
> The compressed form of this sequence would be:
> 17, 26, 13, 20, 10, 5, 8, 4, 2, 1

The compressed form of the Collatz sequence has been the subject of much research, as it provides insights into the behavior of the original sequence and can be used to search for cycles and other patterns. However, the Collatz conjecture itself remains unproven, and the compressed form of the sequence does not provide a proof or disproof of the conjecture.

### Why the name "syracuse" ?

The Collatz conjecture is also known as the Syracuse problem because it was first introduced by Lothar Collatz in a 1950 paper, where he credited his colleague, mathematician Helmut Hasse, with calling it the Syracuse problem. The name "Syracuse" refers to the University of Syracuse, where Collatz was working at the time.

The name "Syracuse problem" has since become a common alternative to "Collatz conjecture", especially in French and Italian-speaking countries, where it is often referred to as the "problÃ¨me de Syracuse" or "problema di Syracuse", respectively.

Regardless of the name used, the conjecture remains one of the most famous and challenging open problems in mathematics, and it continues to attract the attention of mathematicians and computer scientists around the world.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Of course, syracuse cannot run without Python ! More precisely, it requires at least the 3.11 version of our beloved language.

syracuse depends on the following packages. The installation of syracuse should install automatically those packages if they are missing on your system. If it fails, you can install them individually:

* networkx: version 3.0.0 or above

	```sh
	pip install networkx["default"]
	```

* matplotlib: version 3.6.0 or above

	```sh
	pip install matplotlib
	```

* numpy: version 1.24.0 or above

	```sh
	pip install numpy
	```

* pydot: version 1.4.2 or above

	```sh
	pip install pydot
	```

* more-itertools: version 9.1.0 or above

	```sh
	pip install more-itertools
	```

### Installation

Install from PyPi with:

```sh
pip install syracuse
```

As an alternative, you can download the `*.whl` file from the last [release on the syracuse Github repository](https://github.com/devfred78/syracuse/releases), and execute the following command (replace "X.Y.Z" by the right version number):

```sh
pip install syracuse-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl
```

## Usage

Basic usage:

```pycon
>>> # Import the core library
>>> import syracuse

>>> # Create a Syracuse sequence with 27 as initial value
>>> my_sequence = syracuse.Syracuse(27)

>>> # Stopping time
>>> my_sequence.stopping_time
96
>>> # Total stopping time
>>> my_sequence.total_stopping_time
111
>>> # Maximum reached value
>>> my_sequence.max
9232
>>> # Full sequence (until 1)
>>> my_sequence.total_stopping_sequence
