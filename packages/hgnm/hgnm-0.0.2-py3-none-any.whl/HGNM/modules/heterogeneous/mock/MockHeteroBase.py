                Arguments:
            in_node_features:
                Dictionary {node_type: #node_features} of node_types and their input sizes for a heterogeneous graph.
                Node features may have size 0, in which case an empty input graph of the appropriate shape/batch_size
                is expected and the initial embeddings are learned constants

                Dictionary {edge_type: #edge_features} of edge_types and their input sizes for a heterogeneous graph.

                is expected and the initial embeddings are learned constants
            in_global_features:
                If None, no global features will be used (and no GlobalModules created)
                May have size 0, in which case the initial values are a learned constant. This expects (empty) global
                 input tensors and will use the GlobalModule
            latent_dimension:
                Latent dimension of the network. All modules internally operate with latent vectors of this dimension
            scatter_reduce_strs:
                Names of the scatter reduce to use to aggregate messages of the same type.
                Can be any list of "sum", "mean", "max", "min", "std"
            stack_config:
                Configuration of the stack of GNN blocks
            embedding_config:
                Configuration of the embedding stack (can be empty by choosing None, resulting in linear embeddings).
            output_type:
                Either "features" or "graph". Specifies whether the output of the forward pass is a graph
                or a tuple of (node_features, edge_features, global_features)
            create_graph_copy:
                If True, a copy of the input graph is created and modified in-place.
                If False, the input graph is modified in-place.
            assert_graph_shapes:
                If True, the input graph is checked for consistency with the input shapes.
                If False, the input graph is not checked for consistency with the input shapes.
            device:
                Device to use for the module. If None, the default device is used.
            agent_node_type:
                Node type of the agent. Used to determine the node type of the agent.
