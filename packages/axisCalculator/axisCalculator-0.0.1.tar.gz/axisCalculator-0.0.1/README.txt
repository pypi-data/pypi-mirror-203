Robot-Kinematics
This library contains functions that will help you about robotics kinematics

Jacobian Matrix
The Jacobian matrix is a matrix that composes the first-order partial derivatives of a multivariable function. The joints of the robot move with certain velocities then we might want to know with what velocity the endeffector would move. Here is where Jacobian comes to our help.

Robotic Manipülatör with 2 axis
This function help to calculate Velocity Kinematics of 2 axis robots.


Homogenous Matrix
A system of linear equations having matrix form AX = O, where O represents a zero column matrix, is called a homogeneous system.In this project, rotation of homogeneous matrices was performed.
