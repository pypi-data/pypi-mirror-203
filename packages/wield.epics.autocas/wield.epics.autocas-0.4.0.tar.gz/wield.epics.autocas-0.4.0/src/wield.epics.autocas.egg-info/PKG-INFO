wield.pytest
------------------

A set of pytest fixtures and helpers used in the python wield packages and their test suites.

The main purpose of these fixtures is to enable tests to better store and side-effects such as plots and outputs. This helps the pytest test suite to be used and developed more like a Jupyter (or other) notebook.
