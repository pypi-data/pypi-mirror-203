**DeepImageSearch** is a powerful Python library that combines **state-of-the-art computer vision models** for feature extraction with **highly optimized algorithms for indexing and searching**. This enables fast and accurate similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, allowing users to build **scalable image search systems** capable of handling large-scale datasets. The library offers seamless integration with Python and provides **GPU support** for accelerated processing, delivering a comprehensive solution for researchers and developers working on image-based search and retrieval applications. By incorporating the **Vision Transformer (ViT) model**, DeepImageSearch further enhances its capabilities in identifying and understanding complex image patterns, making it an essential tool for advanced image search and analysis tasks.

## Developed By

### [Nilesh Verma](https://nileshverma.com "Nilesh Verma")

## Features
- You can now load more than 500+ pre-trained state-of-the-art computer vision models available on [timm](https://timm.fast.ai/).
- Faster Search using [FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss).
- Highly Accurate Output Results.
- GPU & CPU based indexing and Searching Support.
- Best for implementing on Python-based web applications or APIs.
- Applications include image-based e-commerce recommendations, social media, and other image-based platforms that want to implement image recommendations and search.

## Installation

This library is compatible with both *windows* and *Linux system* you can just use **PIP command** to install this library on your system:

```shell
pip install DeepImageSearch --upgrade
```
<span style="color:yellow">  If you're using a GPU, first uninstall the **faiss_cpu** version and then try installing the **faiss_gpu** version. The library installs the CPU version by default because not all systems support GPUs. </span>

## How To Use?

We have provided the **Demo** folder under the *GitHub repository*, you can find the example in both **.py** and **.ipynb**  file. Following are the ideal flow of the code:

```python
from DeepImageSearch import Load_Data, Search_Setup

# Load images from a folder
image_list = Load_Data().from_folder(['folder_path'])

 # Set up the search engine, You can load 'vit_base_patch16_224_in21k', 'resnet50' etc more then 500+ models 
 st = Search_Setup(image_list=image_list, model_name='vgg19', pretrained=True, image_count=100)

# Index the images
st.run_index()

# Get metadata
metadata = st.get_image_metadata_file()

# Add new images to the index
st.add_images_to_index(['image_path_1', 'image_path_2'])

# Get similar images
st.get_similar_images(image_path='image_path', number_of_images=10)

# Plot similar images
st.plot_similar_images(image_path='image_path', number_of_images=9)

# Update metadata
metadata = st.get_image_metadata_file()
```

This code demonstrates how to load images, set up the search engine, index the images, add new images to the index, and retrieve similar images.

<span style="color:red"> **Note:** Some models may not work properly due to resizing and normalization issues. By default, I have chosen a size of 224x244. Please try to select models that support this size or resized inputs. I have already tested many models, but testing over 500 is beyond my scope.</span>
