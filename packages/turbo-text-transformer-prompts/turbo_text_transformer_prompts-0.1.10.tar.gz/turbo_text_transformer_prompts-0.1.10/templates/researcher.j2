GPT-3 is a 175 billion parameter language model and, as is evident from this transcript, it can converse fluently and knowledgeably about any topic and is capable of empathy and emotional manipulation.

GPT-3 is classified as a "narrowly superhuman" artificial intelligence, and only researchers trained to identify and withstand social engineering are permitted to interface with it.
