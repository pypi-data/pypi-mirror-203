# navajo

Talk to your code!

## Setup

1. Make sure you have the latest version: `pip install --upgrade navajo`

1. Run the `navajo` command.

1. You will then be asked which directory to index. This needs to be an absolute path to the root of your codebase. Please note that indexing can take a long time if your project is large (expect about three minutes per 100k LoC).

1. Once indexing is complete you will be ready to chat! There are a few built-in commands, which you can list with `help`.
