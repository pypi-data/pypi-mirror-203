# Introduction

Helps retrieve configuration information from aws/boto services such as Ssm's Param Store and Secrets Manager,
with the ability the cache a flattened list into a dynamodb table.

Right now this is **pre-release software**, as the dynamo cache table and related need further documentation and testing.

Retrieving values from Param Store and Secrets Manager should work and be relatively fast, as we bulk-grab values
at the various directory-levels that are checked.

**More documentation and testing will be coming soon, for a full 1.0.0 release sometime in the next month or so.**

See **[xcon docs](https://xyngular.github.io/py-xcon/latest/)**.
