# pymacnet

`pymacnet` is a Python module that provides a channel level interface for communication and control of [Maccor cyclers](http://www.maccor.com/) via MacNet. MacNet is an interface provided by Maccor that allows for controlling their cyclers via UDP/IP and TCP/IP. `pymacnet` provides a hassle-free way to utilize MacNet with a simple python class.

# <a name="Motivation"></a>Motivation

Why did we create `pymacnet`? This package enables a wide variety of applications such as:

- Real-time data logging, monitoring and alerting

`pymacnet` can be used to passively monitor running tests and log readings directly to a database, bypassing the need to manually export data. Moreover, it's possible to create automated alerts based on incoming real-time data. For example, if a test were to fault or temperature were to exceed a set threshold. While Maccor already has a built-in notification system with MacNotify, `pymacnet` provides a more flexible and customizable solution without having to directly modify test procedures. 

- Automated test management

The GUI provided by Maccor for test management is straight-forward and easy to use, but requires significant manual work. With `pymacnet` it is possible to write programs to automatically start tests simultaneously across many channels (or even many cyclers) at once.

- Testing of next generation closed-loop charging methods

While conventional constant-current followed by constant-voltage (CCCV) charging has been the industry standard for many years and is well supported by cyclers, there is movement towards advanced [closed-loop control charging techniques that provide improved battery life and decreased charge times](https://battgenie.life/technology/). `pymacnet` enables testing of closed-loop battery charging methods by providing an interface between software hosting battery charging algorithms and active Maccor tests, allowing the charge current to be dynamically set.

- Well tested, easy to use, community supported interface in the most popular programming language. 

It is entirely possible to write one's own MacNet wrapper, but `pymacnet` provides a well-tested ready to use package that takes care of lower level communication, providing a simple yet powerful interface in the most popular programming language. 

# <a name="Installation"></a>Installation

## <a name="Requirements"></a>Requirements

`pymacnet` requires only Python 3 and packages from the standard library. It has been tested on on Windows, Mac, and Debian operating systems.

To install from source clone [this repository](https://github.com/BattGenie/pymacnet), navigate into the directory, and type the following into the command line:

```
pip install .
```

# <a name="Examples"></a>Examples

This section goes over various of examples of how to use `pymacnet` to do such tasks as getting channel readings, starting a test, and even controlling a channel directly without a test procedure. For interactive examples see the `demo.ipynb` notebook in the repository. 

## <a name="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started

`pymacnet` provides a class `MaccorInterface` that communicates with the Maccor cycler via MacNet. Each class instance targets a specific channel of the cycler and requires a configuration dictionary with the following fields:

### <a name="Configuration"></a>Configuration

- `channel` - The channel to be targeted for all operations.
- `test_name` - The test name to be used for any tests started. If left blank, Maccor will generate a unique random name for any started tests. Note that Maccor requires unique test names for each test.
- `test_procedure` - The test procedure to be used, if starting a test with a procedure. Not needed with direct control.
- `c_rate_ah` - The capacity value to be referenced when setting "C" values within the Maccor schedule. Units of amp-hours. Ignored if not used anywhere in the test.
- `v_max_safety_limit_v` - Upper voltage safety limit for the channel. Units of volts.
- `v_min_safety_limit_v` - Lower voltage safety limit for the channel. Units of volts.
- `i_max_safety_limit_a` - Upper current safety limit for the channel. Units of amps.
- `i_min_safety_limit_a` - Lower current safety limit for the channel. Units of amps.
- `v_max_v` - Upper voltage limit used for charge/CV limits. Units of volts. Only used with direct control.
- `v_min_v` - Lower voltage limit used for discharge limit. Units of volts. Only used with direct control.
- `data_record_time_s` - How often data points are taken during direct control tests. Zero turns off. Used only for direct control.
- `data_record_voltage_delta_vbys` - The dV/dt at which data points are taken during direct control tests. Zero disables. Used only for direct control.
- `data_record_current_delta_abys` - The dI/dt at which data points are taken during direct control tests. Zero disables. Used only for direct control.
- `server_ip` - The IP address of the Maccor server. Use 127.0.0.1 if running on the same machine as the server.
- `json_server_port` - The port to communicate through with JSON commands. Default set to 57570.
- `tcp_server_port` - The port to communicate through with TCP commands. Default set to 57560.

## <a name="Readings"></a>Getting Channel Readings

Below is example code for reading channel status (which includes voltage, current, etc.) from channel 75 on a Maccor cycler with IP address `3.3.31.83`.

```python
import time
import sys
import pymacnet 

config = {
    "channel": 75,
    "test_name": "",
    "c_rate_ah": 1,
    "v_max_v": 4.2,
    "v_min_v": 3.0,
    "v_max_safety_limit_v": 4.25,
    "v_min_safety_limit_v": 2.9,
    "i_max_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "i_min_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "data_record_time_s": 0.05,
    "data_record_voltage_delta_vbys": 0.0,
    "data_record_current_delta_abys": 0.0,
    "test_procedure": "test_procedure_1",
    "server_ip": "3.3.31.83",
    "json_server_port": 57570,
    "tcp_server_port": 57560,
    "msg_buffer_size_bytes": 1024
}
    
maccor_interface = pymacnet.MaccorInterface(config)
if not maccor_interface.start():
    sys.exit("failed to create connection!")

status_reading = maccor_interface.read_status()
print(status_reading)
```

Example output:

```
{'FClass': 4, 'FNum': 7, 'Chan': 1, 'RF1': 0, 'RF2': 192, 'Stat': 0, 'LastRecNum': 4225, 'Cycle': 0, 'Step': 5, 'TestTime': 2.0, 'StepTime': 1.0, 'Capacity': 0, 'Energy': 0, 'Current': 0, 'Voltage': 3.85, 'TesterTime': '2022-10-13T12:32:56'}
```

## <a name="Test"></a>Starting a Test

Here is in example of how to start a test named "simple_test_1" on channel 75 with an existing test procedure named "test_procedure_1". Note the safety limits defined in the config will be set on the channel before starting the test. Also, test names must be unique. If a non-unique test name is provided then the test will not start. If no test name is provided then a unique random test name is generated. 

```python
import pymacnet
import sys

config = {
    "channel": 75,
    "test_name": "simple_test_1",
    "c_rate_ah": 1,
    "v_max_v": 4.2,
    "v_min_v": 3.0,
    "v_max_safety_limit_v": 4.25,
    "v_min_safety_limit_v": 2.9,
    "i_max_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "i_min_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "data_record_time_s": 0.05,
    "data_record_voltage_delta_vbys": 0.0,
    "data_record_current_delta_abys": 0.0,
    "test_procedure": "test_procedure_1",
    "server_ip": "3.3.31.83",
    "json_server_port": 57570,
    "tcp_server_port": 57560,
    "msg_buffer_size_bytes": 1024
}
maccor_interface = pymacnet.MaccorInterface(config_dict)
if not maccor_interface.start():
    sys.exit("failed to create connection!")

if maccor_interface.start_test_with_procedure():
    print("Test started!")
```

## <a name="Variables"></a>Setting Variables

Here is an example of how to set VAR1 to 0.01 on a test running on channel 75.

```python
import pymacnet
import sys

config = {
    "channel": 75,
    "test_name": "",
    "c_rate_ah": 1,
    "v_max_v": 4.2,
    "v_min_v": 3.0,
    "v_max_safety_limit_v": 4.25,
    "v_min_safety_limit_v": 2.9,
    "i_max_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "i_min_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "data_record_time_s": 0.05,
    "data_record_voltage_delta_vbys": 0.0,
    "data_record_current_delta_abys": 0.0,
    "test_procedure": "test_procedure_1",
    "server_ip": "3.3.31.83",
    "json_server_port": 57570,
    "tcp_server_port": 57560,
    "msg_buffer_size_bytes": 1024
}

maccor_interface = pymacnet.MaccorInterface(config_dict)
if not maccor_interface.start():
    sys.exit("failed to create connection!")

maccor_interface.set_channel_variable(var_num = 1, var_value = 0.01)
```

## <a name="Direct"></a>Direct Control

Here is an example of how to bypass using a test procedure all together and control the channel directly using direct control.  Note the channel safety limits will be set before the test is started. **WARNING DIRECT CONTROL IS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS. BE CAREFUL AND MAKE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOUR CODE IS DOING.**

```python
import pymacnet
import sys

config = {
    "channel": 75,
    "test_name": "",
    "c_rate_ah": 1,
    "v_max_v": 4.2,
    "v_min_v": 3.0,
    "v_max_safety_limit_v": 4.25,
    "v_min_safety_limit_v": 2.9,
    "i_max_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "i_min_safety_limit_a": 3.0,
    "data_record_time_s": 0.05,
    "data_record_voltage_delta_vbys": 0.0,
    "data_record_current_delta_abys": 0.0,
    "test_procedure": "test_procedure_1",
    "server_ip": "3.3.31.83",
    "json_server_port": 57570,
    "tcp_server_port": 57560,
    "msg_buffer_size_bytes": 1024
}

maccor_interface = pymacnet.MaccorInterface(config_dict)
if not maccor_interface.start():
    sys.exit("failed to create connection!")

if maccor_interface.start_test_with_direct_control():
    print("Test started!")
else:
    sys.exit("Failed to start test!")

time.sleep(1) # Must wait at least 100 ms between trying to set contro

# Discharge at 200 mA for 5 seconds. 
maccor_interface.set_direct_mode_output(current_a = -0.200)
time.sleep(5)

# Rest for 5 seconds
maccor_interface.set_direct_mode_output(current_a = 0)
time.sleep(5) 

# Charge at 200 mA for 5 seconds
maccor_interface.set_direct_mode_output(current_a = 0.200)
time.sleep(5)

maccor_interface.set_direct_mode_output(current_a = 0.0)
time.sleep(1)
```

# <a name="Dev"></a>Development

This section contains various information to help developers further extend and test `pymacnet`

## <a name="Contributing"></a>Contributing

As it exists now, `pymacnet` only implements a fraction of the messages supported by MacNet. Further work can be done to expand `pymacnet` to include more of the messages detailed in the MacNet documentation `docs/macnet_from_maccor_help.pdf`.

We welcome your help in expanding `pymacnet`! Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/BattGenie/pymacnet/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in this repository for contribution guideliens. 

## <a name="Testing"></a>Testing

To run the tests navigate to the "tests" directory and type the following:

```
pytest .
```

### <a name="MaccorSpoofer"></a>MaccorSpoofer

Testing software on a real cycler is dangerous so we've created a submodule `maccorspoofer` to emulate some of the behavior of the Maccor software with a class `MaccorSpoofer`. This class creates TCP and UDP servers and accepts connections from n number of clients. The `MaccorSpoofer` does not perfectly emulate a Maccor cycler (for example, it does not track if a test is already running on a channel) and merely checks that the message format is correct and responds with standard message.
