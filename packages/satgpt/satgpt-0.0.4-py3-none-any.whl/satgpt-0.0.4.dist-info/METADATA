# SatGPT

GPT for satellite mission planning. In development. Get your API keys ready!

SatGPT heavily leverages Shell GPT, a command-line UI for OpenAI's completion API, 
and its features for custom role creation (as of 04/16/2023). Currently for SatGPT to work,
we need to overwrite the default shell roll using the instructions below.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo. Installing from source will be more straightforward than PyPi install at this stage.

2. From inside repo root, install from source.

```
python -m pip install -e . 
```

3. Overwrite `shell-gpt` default `shell` role with `satgpt` alpha demo.

```
python src/satgpt/make_role.py
```
## Usage

1. Start the REPL in shell mode.

```
sgpt --shel --repl temp
```

2. Request a STAC search using natural language

```
>>> find all landsat 8&9 imagery over washington, DC in April 2023
```

3. Request edits or additional steps

```
>>> pipe the results to stacterm cal
```

4. Try other things!
Version 0.0.4:
- Moved role creation to manual script run
- Populated README with basic usage

Version 0.0.3:
- Fixed custom role creation for satgpt to grab target machine os/ shell
- Added pystac as install dependency for demos
- Added this CHANGELOG

Version 0.0.2:
- Integrated shell-gpt as a dependency using the custom role feature released in version 0.9.0
