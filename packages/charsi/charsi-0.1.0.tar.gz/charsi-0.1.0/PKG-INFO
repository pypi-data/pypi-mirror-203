# Charsi

![Charis](./docs/images/charsi-x16.png) **Charsi** is a command-line tool to
help game modders build string resources for [Diablo II: Resurrected][1].

## Introduction

In the classic Diablo era, there was a very famous hacking tool called
d2maphack, which was powerful and easy to configure the display text of items in
the game.

Now in Diablo II: Resurrected, you can directly modify the JSON file to achieve
it, but the workload is heavy and easy to make mistakes.

So there is this tool, which can help you modify the JSON files of Diablo II:
Resurrected in the similar format of d2maphack configurations.

## Quickstart

1. Extract `item-names.json` file at `/data/local/lng/strings` from game data
   storage by [CascView](http://www.zezula.net/en/casc/main.html).

2. Write a recipe file `example.recipe` with following:

```
Text[qf1]: Example
```

3. Run the following command to build a new string table:

```
charsi build --recipe-file=example.recipe item-names.json > new-item-names.json
```

4. Replace file `/data/local/lng/strings/item-names.json`
   with `new-item-names.json` in your mods.

5. Check in game, item name `Khalim's Flail` has been replaced with `Example`.
