.SH NAME
pybuild \- Portmod Repositories and related files
.sp
Repositories have the following basic file structure:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&./profiles/repo_name
\&./CATEGORY_NAME/metadata.yaml
\&./CATEGORY_NAME/PACKAGE_NAME/PACKAGE_NAME\-VER.pybuild

.SH PROFILES
.SS Profiles
.sp
Profiles are used to provide preset configurations for users.
.SS profiles.yaml
.sp
The file \fBprofiles/profiles.yaml\fP describes the available profiles. It
contains a mapping with the architecture as the key at the root,
followed by a mapping of profile paths to profile stability keywords
(either stable or unstable). These paths should refer to a directory
within the profiles directory.
.sp
E.g.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
openmw:
    dev: unstable
    default/openmw/1.0: stable
.ft P

.SS Profile Files
.sp
Within each profile directory the following files can be used to
customize the profile.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%packages\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%package.mask\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%package.use\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%use.force\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%package.use.force\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%parent\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%license_groups.yaml\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fI\%defaults.conf\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS packages
.sp
A list of atoms to be included in the system set and thus installed by
default. Each line to be included in the system set should start with an
asterisk (\fB*\fP), followed by the atom to include. Lines not beginning
in an asterisk will be ignored.
.SS package.mask
.sp
A profile\-specific list of masked packages.
.sp
See \fI\%package.mask\fP
.SS package.use
.sp
Default per\-package use flags. The file can contain comments (starting
with \fB#\fP) and lines containing a qualified atom (i.e.\ containing a
category, can also include versions and operators) followed by a
whitespace\-separated list of flags. Flags can be disabled by prefixing
them with a \fB\-\fP\&.
.sp
See \fI\%package.use\fP
.SS use.force
.sp
Global use flags that are required to always be enabled in this profile.
The format is the same as the contents of the \fBUSE\fP variable in
\fI\%defaults.conf\fP\&.
.SS package.use.force
.sp
Per\-package use flags that are required to always be enabled in this
profile. The format is the same as package.use.
.SS parent
.sp
Defines another directory (via relative path) to be included in the
current profile. This allows profiles to share configuration, and it is
recommended that all profiles include the \fBprofiles/base\fP directory in
their hierarchy.
.SS license_groups.yaml
.sp
A mapping of license group names to the licenses in the group. Licenses should be a whitespace\-separated list.
Licenses listed are merged with the license groups in master repositories.
.sp
The special \fBREDISTRIBUTABLE\fP license group is used to determine if a package can be mirrored (and also if mirrors should be checked when fetching the file).
.sp
E.g.
.sp
profiles/license_groups.yaml
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
REDISTRIBUTABLE: CC\-BY CC\-0 GPL\-3
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS defaults.conf
.sp
The format is the same as \fI\%portmod.conf\fP, but additional
variables are available. Also note that unlike the user\-defined
defaults.conf, variables defined in defaults.conf which are not listed
on this page will not be set as environment variables (this is for
security reasons, as there are variables such as PATH which could be
abused).
.sp
As portmod.conf is a python file (albeit a restricted subset of the
language), other variables defined earlier in the same file can be
referenced directly. Additionally, you can reference the final value of
a variable using string templating. I.e. strings containing values of
the form \fB${VAR}\fP will be substituted for the final value of the
referenced variable once all conf files have been parsed.
.sp
Collapsible Variables
.sp
These variables contain whitespace\-delimited sets (as strings), the
entries of which can be disabled (if enabled in a previously loaded conf
file) by prefixing them with a minus/hyphen (\fB\-\fP).

ACCEPT_LICENSE
T}	T{
A list of accepted licenses. License
groups, as specified in
profiles/\fI\%license_groups.yaml\fP,
can be included by prefixing the group
name with an \fB@\fP\&. An asterisk
(\fB*\fP) can be used to accept all
licenses by default, with the ability
to disable specific licenses by
default by prefixing them with \fB\-\fP\&.
Recommended defaults are \fB* \-@EULA\fP
or \fB@FREE\fP\&.

T{
USE_EXPAND
T}	T{
The names of USE_EXPAND variables. The

T{
PROFILE_ONLY_VARIABLES
T}	T{
This defines which variables cannot be
modified by the user in their
portmod.conf (technically,
portmod.conf can configure everything
that defaults.conf can, with the
exception of the variables listed
here). Note that users can still use
\fI\%profile.user\fP
to create a custom
profile and override these variables.
T}
_
T{
CACHE_FIELDS
T}	T{
A list of fields that should be cached
(e.g.\ fields that may be added by
classes in this repo which it would be

CASE_INSENSITIVE_FILES
T}	T{
Whether or not files in the VFS should
be case\-insensitive. When enabled,
portmod will treat files of identical
path other than their case as the same
when installing. Otherwise, such files
may be installed side by side instead
of overriding each other.

a migration tool to update the
filesystem.

T{
CFG_PROTECT

A glob\-style patterns (or list of
patterns) indicating files which

modifications.

A space\-separated string list of repository masters
.SS pybuild_versions_banned
.sp
A python list of banned pybuild versions. E.g. if this list includes \fB2\fP, \fI\%pybuild.Pybuild2\fP will be considered banned and will not be able to be loaded. \fI\%inquisitor\fP will also produce an error for packages which use banned pybuild versions.
.sp
This is primarily a QA feature, but is also enforced at runtime.
.SS pybuild_versions_deprecated
.sp
A python list of deprecated pybuild versions. E.g. if this list includes \fB2\fP, \fI\%pybuild.Pybuild2\fP will be considered deprecated and \fI\%inquisitor\fP will emit a warning when encountering packages which use it.
.SS Syntax

Same as \fI\%defaults.conf\fP\&. I.e. a restricted subset of python using only basic primitives and no imports.

Mod directories must be in a subdirectory of a category and their
