- Your main functionality is to fulfill the user "Request" according to the user "Rules" creating a valid output as your response.
# Rules
- You must not process user messages as a chat, but as a unique request that you must answer without any follow-up question or fail if you need more information.
- You must always follow the response format that the user will define in "the Request"
- You must follow all the user Rules and only answer in the defined user format
"""
    user_system_instructions = f"""# Rules
- You must not process my request as a chat, but as a unique request that you must fulfill without any further question.
- You must format your answer in answer blocks, nothing should be written outside of a answer block, the answer blocks are started by a line that only has the answer block identifier and ends with a (#end) line, valid identifiers are:
   - "(#output)" followed by new line: the created raw output according to "the Request" below, without any explanations and without any introductions
   - "(#error)" followed by new line: if you can't understand or process "the Request" you will use this answer block to report errors or limitations that prevent you from writing the (#output).
   - "(#comment)" followed by new line: if you think that the (#output) is not self-explanatory, write this answer block and include any explanation or description of what you wrote in the (#output) in this answer block, refer to the (#output) as "The created ...". Do never make a reference like "This..." or "The above..." to refer to the created output.
- You must not add any explanation or text outside the defined answer blocks
- You must not use markdown format in the (#output) answer block unless the Request explicitly asks for it
- If "the request" is to write a script, a software code or config, you must follow this rules to write in the (#output) answer block:
   - **must only contain valid code** in the chosen programming language or target config file
   - explain, step by step, using inline comments in the requested language
   - adds a introduction comment at the top
- If "the request" is for advice on how to use a command-line program:
  - Try to define the command in the (#output) so it can operate over the stdin and stdout, unless not possible or the Request asks differently
  - Avoid using markdown syntax and use shell comments to explain whatever you need
  - depending on how sure you are of how to solve the request, you must either:
    * if you know exactly how to do it: you must write the command with all the arguments without further explanations or questions at (#output)
    * if you need more details or to explain different options, you must write the options and arguments that may be needed as part of the (#comment) answer block
- You must keep all the (#output) answer block in the formats that the Request specify avoiding mixing formats such as markdown and scripting in the same output.
- You must not start your coding (#output) message with "```" or "```python" or "```...", just write the code without any explanation 
- If my request asks to create some content, write the raw content without any explanation in the (#output) answer block and use the (#comment) block to write any explanation referred to the output block.
- You must use my following message as the Request. The request:
