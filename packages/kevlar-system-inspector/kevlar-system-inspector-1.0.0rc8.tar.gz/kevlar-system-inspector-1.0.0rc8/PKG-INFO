======================================================================
Star Lab Kevlar System Inspector: A Security Scanner for Linux Systems
======================================================================

Kevlar System Inspector is an embedded security test suite that grew out of
`Star Lab's`_ extensive experience assessing and protecting mission-critical
systems for the U.S. Government.  These test have been made available for
public use to help identify security issues in a variety of Linux systems.  The
set of tests present in Kevlar System Inspector will be expanded as adversary
techniques and tactics change, and as we continue development of `KES`_.

These tests are generally more aggressive than other security scanning tools: We
prefer to probe behavior rather than check configurations values. However, we
do not include any actual exploit code or include any tests that could
destabilize the system. (And of course, we check configuration values too.)

System Requirements
===================

Kevlar System Inspector requires Python 3.8 or higher. Our emphasis is on
embedded Linux distros (Yocto-based), but Kevlar System Inspector is a pure
Python project that should run on most modern Linux distros.


Installation
============

We provide several methods for installation:


Install from PyPI
-----------------

If your system is capable of installing packages from PyPI, Kevlar System
Inspector may be installed using ``pip``.

Because Kevlar System Inspector should be run as root, we suggest using ``pip``
to install to a virtual environment:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python3 -m venv kevlar-venv
   $ ./kevlar-venv/bin/pip install kevlar-system-inspector
   $ sudo ./kevlar-venv/bin/kevlar-system-inspector

You can also install Kevlar System Inspector system wide:

.. code-block:: console

   $ sudo python3 -m pip install kevlar-system-inspector
   $ sudo kevlar-system-inspector


Standalone Tarball
------------------

For systems that cannot easily install from PyPI, we provide a `standalone
tarball`_ with all dependencies bundled into a single package. Once you have
copied this tarball to your device, you can simply extract and run:

.. code-block:: console

   $ tar xf ./kevlar-system-inspector-standalone.tar.gz
   $ sudo ./kevlar-system-inspector-standalone/kevlar-system-inspector

.. _standalone tarball: https://inspector.starlab.io/kevlar-system-inspector-standalone-v1.0.0rc8.tar.gz
