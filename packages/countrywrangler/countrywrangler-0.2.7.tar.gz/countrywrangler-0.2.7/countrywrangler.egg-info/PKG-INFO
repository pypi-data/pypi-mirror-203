  <p align="center">
CountryWrangler is a Python library that simplifies the handling of country-related data by converting country codes, names, TLDs, phone numbers, timezones, currencies, and languages to proper ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 country codes. With CountryWrangler, you can easily standardize your data and make it consistent across your project. The library is designed for speed and efficiency, making it easy to process large datasets in no time.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
CountryWrangler is a high-performance Python library that has taken inspiration from `pycountry` and has surpassed it in terms of speed. With CountryWrangler, converting an Alpha-3 to an Alpha-2 (USA -> US) country code takes a mere 8900 nanoseconds, while the same conversion with `pycountry` on an Intel i7-10700K CPU @ 3.80GHz takes 282.636.700 nanoseconds. 

While `pycountry` is primarily designed to serve as a database for ISO standards, CountryWrangler is specifically developed to normalize country data. Both libraries cater to their respective use cases. Additionally, CountryWrangler offers extra functions that are designed to handle messy country data with ease.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation
Binary installers for the latest released version are available at the Python Package Index (PyPI)
 ```sh
 pip install countrywrangler
 ```

 
 
 <p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>
 
 
 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Basic Usage

### Country Name to Alpha-2
`name_to_alpha2` takes in a string and searches for a corresponding alpha-2 code in the database for both common and official country names in 34 different languages. If no match is found, `None` is returned.

Full documentation: https://countrywrangler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/normalize/country_name/

```python
import countrywrangler as cw

alpha2 = cw.Normalize.name_to_alpha2("Germany")
print(alpha2)

>>> DE
```

The `use_fuzzy=True` option captures and matches virtually all variations of country names. Although using fuzzy lookup may incur a significant performance cost of approximately 100x slower than the normal lookup.

```python
import countrywrangler as cw

alpha2 = cw.Normalize.name_to_alpha2("Germany Federal Republic of", use_fuzzy=True)
print(alpha2)

>>> DE
```


### Country Code to Alpha-2
`code_to_alpha2` converts both alpha-3 and alpha-2 codes to alpha-2 format, and returning None in the absence of a match.
This can also be used to validate if a given string is a country code.

Full documentation: https://countrywrangler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/normalize/country_code/

```python
import countrywrangler as cw

alpha2 = cw.Normalize.code_to_alpha2("GBR")
print(alpha2)

>>> GB
```


### Phone Number to Alpha-2
`phone_to_alpha2` accepts a string or integer representing a phone number in international format (E.164) and returns the corresponding ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code of the phone number's origin. If the input is not a valid phone number, the function returns `None`.

> **Warning**
> Please ensure that the input provided is a valid phone number, as almost any numerical input can be matched to an alpha-2 country code. This function does not validate whether the input is a phone number.

Full documentation: https://countrywrangler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/normalize/phone/

```python
import countrywrangler as cw

alpha2 = cw.Normalize.phone_to_alpha2("+1 (222) 333-4444 ")
print(alpha2)

>>> US
```



### TLD to Alpha-2
`tld_to_alpha2` retrieves the country code associated with a given Top-Level Domain (TLD). If a match is found, the function returns the country code in ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 format. Otherwise, it returns None.

Full documentation: https://countrywrangler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/normalize/tld/

```python
import countrywrangler as cw

alpha2 = cw.Normalize.tld_to_alpha2(".co.uk")
print(alpha2)

>>> GB
```

### Timezone to Alpha-2
`timezone_to_alpha2` takes a geographic timezone name such as `Europe/Vienna` and returns the corresponding alpha-2 country code e.g., `AT` if it's an exact match. If there's no exact match, the function returns `None` instead.

Full documentation: https://countrywrangler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/normalize/timezone/

```python
import countrywrangler as cw

alpha2 = cw.Normalize.timezone_to_alpha2("Europe/Vienna")
print(alpha2)

>>> AT
```


### Language to Alpha-2
`language_to_alpha2` matches ISO 639-1, ISO 639-2 language codes and IETF language tags to an ISO-3361-1 Alpha-2 country code. 
It is important to note that while IETF language tags will always be unambiguous, ISO codes may not be. For instance, 
the code `ES` can produce a list of country codes corresponding to all countries where Spanish is spoken.

> **Warning**
>   If it is not desired that ambiguous country codes are being returned as a list, the option `allow_ambiguous=False` can be 
    passed as a parameter. This will restrict the output to a single, unambiguous country code. I case matching ambiguous countries is not turned off the function either returns a string (uambiguous) or a list (ambiguous), you code must be able to handle the different types.

Full documentation: https://countrywrangler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/normalize/language/

```python
import countrywrangler as cw

alpha2 = cw.Normalize.language_to_alpha2("en-US")
print(alpha2)

>>> US
```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [x] Fuzzy lookup for country names
- [x] Support language code to to alpha2
- [ ] Option to exclude languages from country name matching
- [ ] Support for subdivisions to alpha2
- [ ] Support for city to to alpha2
- [ ] Add more alternative country names

See the [open issues](https://github.com/TheHenryWills/CountryWrangler/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

<!-- UPDATEPOLICY -->
## Data Update Policy
Updates to the ISO 3361 standards are monitored and immediately added upon changes or additions.
No changes to the data will be accepted into CountryWrangler unless it is plain simple wrong.
