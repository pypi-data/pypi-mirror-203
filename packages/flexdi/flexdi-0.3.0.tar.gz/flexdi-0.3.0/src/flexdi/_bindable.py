        Bind a provider to a resolve a particular type.

        By default, this method will examine the return type annotations on the
        provided callable to determine what it should resolve. In cases where you
        want to be more specific, you can choose to explicitly list the value type
        that should be resolved.

        For generator and iterator type providers, the generic parameter will be
        pulled out and used to determine the type. i.e.

        * A function returning ``Iterator[T]`` binds to ``T``
        * A function returning ``Generator[T, U, V]`` binds to ``T``
        * A function returning ``AsyncIterator[T]`` binds to ``T``
        * A function returning ``AsyncGenerator[T, U]`` binds to ``T``

        If the binding is set as eager, the provider will be invoked as soon as
        the graph is opened. This is useful for applications which chain the
        graph instance.

        This method can be used as a no-argument decorator, a standard decorator,
        or used as a normal function call. e.g. these are all valid uses:

        .. code-block:: python

            @graph.bind
            def provide_foo() -> Foo:
                ...

            @graph.bind()
            def provide_foo() -> Foo:
                ...

            graph.bind(provide_foo)

        :param func: The callable that provides the binding, defaults to None

        :type scope: "application" | "request"

        :param resolves: The type or types that this provider binds to.
            defaults to the return type annotation of the provided func
        :type resolves: Any, optional

        :param eager: If the binding eager, defaults to False
        :type eager: bool

        :return: Either a decorator or the unedited function supplied.
