# 🫒 Oils 

*"Build numerical simulations with ease"*

## ☕️ About
**Oils** provides a **high-level interface** 
for solving [Partial Differential Equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation) using the [Finite Element Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method) in a **minimal** lines of code.

The aim of **Oils** is to **manage** the **cumberstone stuff** wich is generally involved when finite elements simulations are developed. Thus, the **user** can be more focused on the **problem** to solve and the **physics** rather than to be **absorbed** in technical implementations details.

## 🔋 Batteries included

We do not want to **reinvent the wheel**, that's why **Oils** is built upon **"shoulders giants"** in the field. It is **batteries included** wich means that the necessary **tooling** is provided in order to craft **end to end** finite element simulations :

- 🕸️ Mesh generation ([Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/)) 
- ⚙️ Efficient FEM solver ([FEniCSx](https://fenicsproject.org/))
- 📈 Results visualization ([PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/),[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) )

## ⚠️ Under construction
This package is at the **early developement stage** and is truly **experimental**.
This mean **most** of the features are **missing**, the documentation is still **lacking** and somes **API broken changes** will append.
