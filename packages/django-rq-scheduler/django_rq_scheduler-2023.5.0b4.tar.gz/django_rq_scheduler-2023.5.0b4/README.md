>  **Warning**: In v2023.3.0, django-rq-scheduler was refactored significantly to support
> calculation of parameters in runtime.
> You can now add a callable param to your scheduled job, and it will be
> calculated when the job is performed.
> 
> 1. It is highly recommended you save your existing database before upgrading!
> 2. Once you upgraded, recreate your jobs.

> **Note** Starting v2023.1, requirement for rq_scheduler was removed and instead
> one of the django-rq workers should run with `--with-scheduler` parameter
> as mentioned [here](https://github.com/rq/django-rq#support-for-scheduled-jobs).
