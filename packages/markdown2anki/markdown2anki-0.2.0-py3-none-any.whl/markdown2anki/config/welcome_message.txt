Welcome to MD 2 Anki! 💕

Before starting, we need to create your configuration file. 🔧

The configuration file will allow you to maintain your configuration between 
versions and tailor the behaviour of the app to your liking. 🐙

You can come back to this screen to reconfigure the location of the file by
running "MD2Anki -cf" or "MD2Anki --configfile".

❗Notice: if a configuration is already present (for example, when updating),
the old configuration is maintained and, if new options have been added, 
updated with new options.

You can exit this menu at any point by writing "exit".

Please input an absolute path to an existing folder where your config file will
be added.
