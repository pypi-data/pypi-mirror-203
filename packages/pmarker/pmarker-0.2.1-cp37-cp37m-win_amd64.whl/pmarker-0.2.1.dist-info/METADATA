pmarker is built on top of the pymupdf package, which provides a range of PDF manipulation capabilities. pmarker is designed to be easy to use and integrate with existing workflows. It can be installed via pip and is compatible with Python 3. 

pmarker support both text and image marking based on the content of the notes, it provide a convenient way to mark up and annotate images in conjunction with notes and other textual content. The package provides four basic marker types: PAR, CTH, Claim, and Example, which can be used to mark different sections of a document.

To use pmarker, you simply need to provide the PDF file you want to mark and a file containing the note content in the required format. The package will then automatically generate a new PDF file with the notes and annotations added. This saves time and effort and makes the process of marking up a PDF file much more efficient and convenient.

Overall, pmarker is a powerful and versatile tool for anyone who needs to mark up and annotate PDF documents, from researchers and academics to business professionals and students.
