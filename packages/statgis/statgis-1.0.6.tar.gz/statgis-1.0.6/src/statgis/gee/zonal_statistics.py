        Region of interest to reduce the image.

    bands : Sequence | str (optional)
        List, tuple with the bands of interest or, if you only want one band, the name

    reducer : ee.Reducer | str (optional)
        Reducer to apply to the image. By default, image are reduced to its, mean, standard
        deviation, maximum, minimum, and count.

    tile_scale : int (optional)
        Scale of the mosaic to allow EarthEngine to split the task to more cores.
