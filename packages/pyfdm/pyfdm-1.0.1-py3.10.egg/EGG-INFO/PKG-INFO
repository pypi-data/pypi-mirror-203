# Usage example

Below the sample example of the package functionalities is presented.
More usage examples of available methods are presented in [Jupyter examples](https://github.com/jwieckowski/pyfdm).

```python
from pyfdm.methods import fARAS
from pyfdm.helpers import rank
import numpy as np

if __name__ == '__main__':
    matrix = np.array([
        [[5, 7, 9], [5, 7, 9], [7, 9, 9]],
        [[1, 3, 5], [3, 5, 7], [3, 5, 7]],
        [[1, 1, 3], [1, 3, 5], [1, 3, 5]],
        [[7, 9, 9], [7, 9, 9], [7, 9, 9]]
    ])
    
    weights = np.array([[5, 7, 9], [7, 9, 9], [3, 5, 7]])
    types = np.array([1, -1, 1])
    
    f_aras = fARAS()
    pref = f_aras(matrix, weights, types)

    print(f'Fuzzy ARAS preferences: {pref}')
    print(f'Fuzzy ARAS ranking: {rank(pref)}')
```

Output:

```bash
Fuzzy ARAS preferences: 1.011 0.854 1.312 0.993
Fuzzy ARAS ranking: 2 4 1 3
```
