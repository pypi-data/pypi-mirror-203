# Tutorials

These tutorials are for anyone who wants to use PyperCard to create their own
GUI driven applications that run, via a browser, on Windows, OSX, Linux,
Android and iOS. If you're just looking for a technical reference you should
check out the [cheatsheet](cheatsheet.md).

We assume only two things:

1. You're comfortable typing code into your computer via some sort of
   programming environment (like [pyscript.com](https://pyscript.com/) or the
   [Mu code editor](https://codewith.mu)).
2. You know a little of, or are starting to learn, the Python programming
   language.

By the end of these relatively short and simple tutorials you'll know how to
build and share applications with PyperCard. If you want further help and
support, please don't hesitate to ask for help in the
[#pypercard channel](https://discord.gg/TKyjvSynTP)
on our discord server.

Most of all, we're a friendly project and want folks to flourish with our code,
so don't hesitate to get involved, give feedback and constructive critique.
