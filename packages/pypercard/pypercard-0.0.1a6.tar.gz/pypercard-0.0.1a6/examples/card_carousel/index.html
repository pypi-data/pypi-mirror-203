    <template id="card1">
      <h1>Auto advance</h1>
      <p>Sometimes you just want one card to transition to another, with no
      interaction from the user, and after a certain period of time.</p>
      <p>For example, this card will transition to the next card after 10
      seconds.</p>
    </template>
    <template id="card2">
      <h2>The second card</h2>
      <p>This card will automatically transition to the third card after 20
      seconds, by calling a user defined function with some simple counting
      logic in it. The user defined function simply returns a string containing
      the name of the next card to render.</p>
      <p>But if you click the button, you'll transition back to the
      first card, and the automatic transition won't happen.</p>
      <button id="reset" autofocus>Reset</button>

    <template id="card3">
      <h2>The final card</h2>
      <p>That's it! This card has been displayed {counter} time[s].</p>
      <p>It will automatically transition back to the first after 5
      seconds.</p>
