# Images

Mostly sourced from Wikicommons and freely licensed photos found on
the internet by folks who'd visited the tower at Bollingen. Edited, re-touched
and photoshopped by the author.

All others covered by fair use for educational
purposes -- this game will be an example for beginners learning to code.
