;       quantification (e.g., that all humans are mortal) by
;       providing a total function as an instance of a
;       corresponding type.

; These might be considered as assertions that Plato and

(: SocratesIsHuman (Human Socrates))
(: PlatoIsHuman (Human Plato))
; `(HumansAreMortal SocratesIsHuman)` might be considered
; as a proof that that `(Mortal Socrates)`.

; A standard type-theoretic way of saying that some equality is true

; Such syntax `(: (Refl $x) (-> Type (= $x $x)))` also doesn't work now.

; Another (MeTTa) way is to have explicit reduction of types to True
; (equalities over equalities), although a more practical way would
; be just to use a dedicated comparison operator
