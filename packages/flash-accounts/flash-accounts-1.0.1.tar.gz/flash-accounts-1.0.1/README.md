## **About**

Flash Accounts is a DRF lightweight reusable app for account management.  
It ships the following functionalities:

-   user registration,
-   user account activation,
-   password reset.

## **Requirements**

-   python >= 3.7
-   django >= 3.0
-   djangorestframework >= 3.11.0

## **Getting started**

### **Installation**

Flash Accounts can be installed with pip by running the following command:

```console
pip install flash-accounts
```

### **Configuration**

Add `flash_accounts` along `rest_framework` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in project's `settings.py` file:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    "rest_framework",
    "flash_accounts",
    # ...
]
```

Include Flash Accounts endpoints in project's `urls.py` file:

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    # ...
    path("api/auth/", include("flash_accounts.urls")),
    # ...
]
```

Configure an email backend. During development, you can use the console backend. Add the following line to the projects's `settings.py` file:

```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = "django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend"
```

**Note**: It is necessary to declare an email backend for Flash Accounts to work correctly.  
You can learn about Django email backends [here.](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/topics/email/#email-backends)

<br>
Finally, run migrations by the following command:

```console
python manage.py migrate
```

**Note**: Flash Accounts migrations will create tables for `ActivationToken` and `PasswordResetToken` models.  
Flash Accounts do not provide custom user model, so you can (and should as it is explained [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/auth/customizing/#using-a-custom-user-model-when-starting-a-project)) set up your own.

## **Usage**

Flash accounts provide the following API endpoints:

```python
 - "/sign-up/"
 - "/account/activate/<str:token_value>/"
 - "/account/activate-resend/"
 - "/password-reset/"
 - "/password-reset/confirm/<str:token_value>/"
```

### <li><b> `/sign-up/` </b></li>

Allows user to create an account.

```python
URL: /sign-up/
HTTP METHOD: POST
HEADERS: {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
SUCCESS CODE: 201 Created

DATA FIELDS = "username", "email", "password", "password2"
```

Example:

```console
curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "username": "user01",
        "email": "user01@user.com",
        "password": "userpassword123",
        "password2": "userpassword123"
    }' \
    http://localhost:8000/api/auth/sign-up/

```

### <li><b> `/account/activate/<str:token_value>/` </b></li>

```python
URL: /account/activate/<str:token_value>/
HTTP METHOD: GET
SUCCESS CODE: 200 OK
```

Example:

```console

    http://localhost:8000/api/auth/password-reset/

{
    "response": "Email with instructions has been sent to user01@user.com"
}
```

### <li><b> `/password-reset/confirm/<str:token_value>/` </b></li>

## **Settings**

### **Default settings**

The default settings values are shown below:

```python
from django.utils import timezone
from django.conf import settings

DEFAULT_SETTINGS = {
    "ACTIVATE_ACCOUNT": True,
    "ACTIVATION_TOKEN_LIFETIME": timezone.timedelta(hours=1),
    "ACTIVATION_EMAIL_TEMPLATE": "flash_accounts/activate",
    "ACTIVATION_EMAIL_SUBJECT": "Activate your account.",
    "PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_LIFETIME": timezone.timedelta(hours=1),
    "PASSWORD_RESET_EMAIL_TEMPLATE": "flash_accounts/password_reset",
    "PASSWORD_RESET_EMAIL_SUBJECT": "Password reset request.",
    "EMAIL_FROM": getattr(settings, "DEFAULT_EMAIL_FROM", "change@me.com"),
}
```

#### <li><b> `ACTIVATE_ACCOUNT` </b></li>

When set to `True`, the registered account with the [`/sign-up/`](#sign-up) endpoint is created with the `is_active` field set to `False`, and an email with an activation link is sent to the user.  
When set to `False`, the registered account with the [`/sign-up/`](#sign-up) endpoint is created with the `is_active` field set to `True`, and no further actions are required. With that setting set to `False`, the following endpoints will not be available:

-   [`/account/activate/<str:token_value>/`](#accountactivatestrtoken_value)
-   [`/account/activate-resend/`](#accountactivate-resend)

#### <li><b> `ACTIVATION_TOKEN_LIFETIME` </b></li>

A `django.utils.timezone.timedelta` objects that determines how long the activation token remains valid.

#### <li><b> `ACTIVATION_EMAIL_TEMPLATE` </b></li>

Path to the activation email templates, **without** the file extension. This path points to two files:

-   activate.html
-   activate.txt

#### <li><b> `ACTIVATION_EMAIL_SUBJECT` </b></li>

Subject of activation email that is sent when new user registers.

#### <li><b> `PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_LIFETIME` </b></li>

A `django.utils.timezone.timedelta` objects that determines how long the password reset token is valid.

#### <li><b> `PASSWORD_RESET_EMAIL_TEMPLATE` </b></li>

Path to the password reset email templates, **without** the file extension. This path points to two files:

-   password_reset.html
-   password_reset.txt

#### <li><b> `PASSWORD_RESET_EMAIL_SUBJECT` </b></li>

Subject of password reset email that is sent when user requests password reset.

#### <li><b> `EMAIL_FROM` </b></li>

An email address from which emails will appear to be sent.  
Flash Accounts first checks if `DEFAULT_EMAIL_FROM` field is set in project's `settings.py` file.

### **Customizing settings**

Every setting value can be customized by creating a `FLASH_SETTINGS` dictionary in project's `settings.py` file.

Example:

```python
from django.utils import timezone

FLASH_SETTINGS = {
    "ACTIVATE_ACCOUNT": False,
    "PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_LIFETIME": timezone.timedelta(days=1),
    "EMAIL_FROM": "noreply@localhost.com",
}
```

#### **Overriding templates**

Email templates are located in `flash_accounts/templates/flash_accounts/` directory:

```
└── flash_accounts
    └── templates
        └── flash_accounts
            ├── activate.html
            ├── activate.txt
            ├── password_reset.html
            └── password_reset.txt
```

With that directory structure, the `APP_DIRS` setting value in the `TEMPLATES` section in project's `settings.py` must be set to `True`.  
If you want to provide your own email templates, you must place them in a valid Django templates directory.

Example:  
You can specify general templates directory:

```python
TEMPLATES = {
    # ...
    "DIRS": [BASE_DIR / "templates"],
    # ...
}
```

and put your templates in that directory:

```
└── drf_project
    ├── base
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── asgi.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   ├── urls.py
    │   └── wsgi.py
    ├── app_1
    ├── app_2
    ├── manage.py
    └── templates
        └── emails
            ├── custom_activation.html
            ├── custom_activation.txt
            ├── custom_password_reset.html
            └── custom_password_reset.txt
```

With that, you can specify the path to the templates:

```python
FLASH_SETTINGS = {
    # ...
    "ACTIVATION_EMAIL_TEMPLATE": "emails/custom_activation",
    "PASSWORD_RESET_EMAIL_TEMPLATE": "emails/custom_password_reset",
    # ...
}
```

It is nesseccary to include the `{{ url }}` Django template tag in your custom template files, so that emails will contain activation links or password reset links.  
Optional tags include `{{ username }}` and `{{ host }}`.
